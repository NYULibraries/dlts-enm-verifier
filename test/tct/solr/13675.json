Another basic difficulty, implicitly apparent, I am sure, in the very controversiality of much of what I have said so far, is our deep pluralism regarding the values that drive these practice-based partial and temporary solutions. Property is a perennially contested concept, as are the concepts of liberty, personhood, and polity on which it is supposed to rest. We do not have consensus on the requirements of corrective justice, on the significance, if any, of the personal/fungible continuum, or on the appropriate way to theorize about politics and to construe our political practice. This pluralism does not mean that there cannot be better and worse answers, solutions, or principles associated with the takings issue. It means only that the better—the right—answers will not have the open-and-shut quality that we expect from rules and that drives the old ideal of the Rule of Law.\nIn my view these two intertwined difficulties, the problem of trying to achieve formal rules in the face of the stubborn relevance of circumstances, and the problem of pluralism in basic liberal values, together account for much of the disarray in takings jurisprudence. They render the takings issue resistant to general solutions. The resistance stems in part from recalcitrant theory: the continuing contestedness of moral and political theory relating to property and our need to make decisions with broad philosophical ramifications while the philosophers are still arguing, as they always will be. The resistance arises also from recalcitrant practice: the stubborn situatedness of people and their property, and the endless variations in property relations. This protean aspect of property is part of the reason why property, like liberty, is a central value in liberal schemes, but ironically, it is also the reason why property problems resist the liberal commitment to rules.\n"},"document":{"title":"Compensatory Justice","author":"John W.
