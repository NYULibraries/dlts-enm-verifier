As Shankar puts it, “some are born with identities, others have identities thrust on them.”\nIndira Karamcheti, English professor at Wesleyan University, is also concerned about the commodification of identity in the multicultural university. As a member of a non-American ethnic group teaching primarily white American students, Karamcheti has always been different from the students she teaches.
