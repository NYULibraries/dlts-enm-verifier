Thus, in this sense, offshore assembly substitutes for immigrant labor. High export barriers (e.g., into Mexico) have partially kept the United States from being able to utilize the same potential advantages of specializing domestically in capital/skill intensive production. GATT and NAFTA become relevant in this regard.\nThe problem with discussing these issues as though Japan does not use immigrant workers is that the assumption is not true. Foreign workers started to flood into Japan in the mid-1980s, when Japan suffered serious labor shortages. Immigrants, eager to earn salaries that were “astronomical” compared to what they were earning back home, availed themselves of thousands of jobs in bars, restaurants, small factories, and construction. In spite of a recession, the demand for foreign labor in Japan has not eased. Employers have difficulty finding native workers to take low-paying and physically taxing work at construction sites and in factories. Many foreign workers do not have proper visas, and the Japanese labor ministry estimated the presence of 280,000 undocumented workers in 1993, mostly from the Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and the Middle East.34\nJapan has finally recognized its need for immigrant workers. Like South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia, Japan is a country short of labor which has experienced a steady and perceptible flow of unskilled foreign workers. Interestingly, the flow of undocumented workers into Japan continues to grow in spite of stringent amendments to Japanese immigration laws in 1990. Legal immigration of 114,000 foreign workers occurred in the first year after the changes, while another 150,000 second- or third-generation Japanese arrived from South America. Recognizing the need for these workers, the Japanese government proposed a technical job training program for foreign workers, permitting unskilled foreign workers to reside in Japan for up to two years. Today, foreign workers are viewed by some Japanese opinion leaders as a “labor-saving investment” that would complement native workers and make it easier for women and older people to enter and stay in the Japanese workforce.35\nComparing the world-renowned Japanese automobile industry with that in the United States and Europe is also instructive on the question of whether the Japanese have it right and we are wrong. The Japanese “lean” production system is highly extolled. Among the key elements are “continual improvement, teamwork, elimination of waste, and efficient "},"document":{"title":"TO BE AN AMERICAN","author":"Bill Ong Hing","publisher":"NEW YORK UNIVERSITY PRESS","id":69,"isbn":"9780814735237"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":20630,"display_name":"Automobile industry"},"id":70034,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":26888,"display_name":"General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) -- and advantages of specializing domestically in capital/skill intensive production"},"id":70204,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":26912,"display_name":"Immigrants -- flood to Japan"},"id":70234,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":26949,"display_name":"Japanese immigration law"},"id":70286,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":26975,"display_name":"Labor (workforce) -- Japan's shortage"},"id":70317,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_126","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch06.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_126\">","css_selector":"#page_126","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_126\"]"},"next_location_id":18429,"previous_location_id":18427}]
