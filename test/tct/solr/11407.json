Fringe benefit plans could provide legal care, eye care, dental care, child care, care for the aging parents of employees, and parental leave for workers having or adopting children. These programs can be cost-efficient. For example, employers have discovered that the cost of providing child care coverage is outweighed by the savings achieved through reduced absenteeism, improved employee morale, and the enhanced ability to attract and retain qualified workers.37 Individuals with satisfactory personal lives are generally more productive than those experiencing personal problems.\nDuring the coming years, representative labor organizations should utilize collective bargaining to protect bargaining unit employees from the vicissitudes associated with the introduction of new technology, production transfers, and plant closures.

Labor leaders have recognized the need for modern production techniques,38 and they have the right to demand that business firms reciprocate with the establishment of educational programs that would prepare affected bargaining unit personnel for future occupational demands.39 Individuals displaced by automation should be entitled to continued compensation during the period of their retraining.40 The ongoing employment of such workers would be benevolent, would greatly increase employee loyalty to the firm, and would diminish costly employee turnover and guarantee a highly skilled future workforce.41\nUnions should demand contractual restrictions aimed at diminishing the likelihood of such business transactions.
