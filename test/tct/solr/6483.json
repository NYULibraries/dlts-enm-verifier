The ethics were fuzzy, and they didn't quite make sense to some journalists who tried to have a personality online. Journalists were still figuring out just how much they should pay attention to what their audiences had to say on these new forums. One lesson from this is that, if we do want to consider how we might rethink the journalist-reader relationship, we need to consider the specific goals of the newsroom and journalists in relation to the more theoretical aspirations of user engagement.\nWhat emerges from looking at how journalists engage with social media is that participation is not what journalism theorists say it is or ought to be. For theorists and journalism prognosticators, there is already a stable value called “participation” that should reorder journalism: the audience and the journalist should be in conversation; the authority of the journalist should be meshed with citizen contributions; the one-to-many flow of information should be replaced with a more many-to-many conversation. But for these journalists, the very act of even engaging on participatory platforms was contested. Just joining Twitter was up for debate. Forget having a conversation about the deep advantages of changing journalism and benefiting from user experience; few understood the potential. Even starting to have this conversation was contested.\nYet ultimately, citizen engagement online may help the newspaper survive. Creating shareable content matters economically, and making that content maximally shareable, via Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, or whatever it might be, requires journalist participation. Being on social media platforms may become nonnegotiable, and it may be that participation in practice has a different meaning than it does in theory. In practice, participation may just mean talking to the audience in non-traditional ways, telling stories differently, and creating an online identity that users can recognize. Participation may have little to do with actual conversation, much to the potential dismay of Internet theorists. But nonetheless, some version of participation reordering newswork was emerging in the newsroom of The Times, signaling change and underscoring the emergence of new values ordering online journalism in the digital age, just as interactivity and immediacy were.\n\n\n\n"},"document":{"title":"Making News at The New York Times","author":"Usher, Nikki","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":30,"isbn":"9780472120499"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":8108,"display_name":"branding"},"id":27068,"ring_next":6457,"ring_prev":6475},{"basket":{"id":8138,"display_name":"citizen contributors"},"id":27174,"ring_next":6482,"ring_prev":6482},{"basket":{"id":8175,"display_name":"engagement"},"id":27286,"ring_next":6487,"ring_prev":6479},{"basket":{"id":2678,"display_name":"ethics"},"id":27301,"ring_next":6503,"ring_prev":6476},{"basket":{"id":262,"display_name":"Facebook"},"id":27330,"ring_next":6491,"ring_prev":6479},{"basket":{"id":8279,"display_name":"interactivity -- values"},"id":27690,"ring_next":6501,"ring_prev":6455},{"basket":{"id":369,"display_name":"Twitter"},"id":28557,"ring_next":6485,"ring_prev":6481},{"basket":{"id":8541,"display_name":"values"},"id":28599,"ring_next":6484,"ring_prev":6465}],"localid":"page_215","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter06.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_215\">","css_selector":"#page_215","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_215\"]"},"next_location_id":6484,"previous_location_id":6482}]
