Legal process scholars believed that a methodology was needed to engage true decision making according to rules in hard constitutional cases. In the face of what was perceived as an openly interventionalist Supreme Court, process theorists sought to rehabilitate the idea of an autonomous neutral law.\nProfessor Herbert Wechsler of Columbia University attempted to do this in his 1959 Holmes lecture at Harvard Law School, entitled Toward Neutral Principles of Constitutional Law.69 Wechsler surprised the academic world by launching a broad-scale attack on the Warren Court and some of its leading civil-liberties decisions. He engaged the concept of “reasoned elaboration” to criticize the Warren Court decision in Brown as well as decisions in cases involving the white primary70 and the enforcement of racially restrictive covenants.71 The lecture charged the Warren Court with choosing outcomes in these cases merely because the justices agreed upon the substantive policies those outcomes affirmed. Wechsler believed that the Warren Court was becoming a dangerous “naked power organ” rather than a court of law.72 His antidote was a call for reasoned elaboration in constitutional adjudication. For Wechsler, this meant the Court should commit itself to a form of legal reasoning that is “genuinely principled, resting with respect to every step that is involved in reaching judgment on analysis and reasons quite transcending the immediate result that is achieved.”73\nWechsler believed that Chief Justice Warren’s opinion in Brown flunked his “neutral principles” test, because Warren failed to identify a reason or principle for his outcome that would transcend the immediate result of the case. He argued that Brown relied upon flimsy empirical evidence to establish that racial segregation in public education was a denial of constitutional equality. Wechsler believed the Court failed to provide a principled reason why the right to a desegregated school should trump the segregationist right not to associate. He thought someone should attempt to identify a principle to justify Brown, but he was pressed to admit that even he could “not yet [write] the opinion.”74\nYale University Law School professor Alexander M. Bickel responded to Wechsler’s challenge by offering a new category between policy and rationality, which Bickel dubbed “passive virtues” in his influential 1962 book, THE LEAST DANGEROUS BRANCH.75 Passive virtues referred to the various legal doctrines and procedures judges frequently employed to "},"document":{"title":"Postmodern Legal Movements","author":"Gary Minda","publisher":"New York University Press","id":93,"isbn":"9780814755112"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":33125,"display_name":"Bickel, Alexander M."},"id":96546,"ring_next":26229,"ring_prev":22180},{"basket":{"id":38796,"display_name":"Brown v.
