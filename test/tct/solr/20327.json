Had he been a thoroughgoing Hellenist, his idea of balance might have resembled the golden mean wherein everything is trimmed of excess and reduced to the palatable, but Arnold finally preferred a more dynamic and athletic notion of homeostasis, less an average than an offsetting of opposing elements. Much as he celebrated “sweetness and light,” he was unwilling to renounce those expressions of faith characterized by “fire and strength,” which he recognized as having their own value in a culture.\nIn contrast to Arnold’s time, we have erred on the side of Hellenism. We are plainly uncomfortable with the unverifiable and the extraordinary. We prefer the blandness of the bureaucrat to the supernal vision of the seer. Our cynicism prevents us from crediting claims on the divine. We view the prophetic tradition as remarkably naive in its faith in ultimate goodness. We prefer to look for the snake lurking behind every purported angel. Our distrust of prophets is really a reflection of a profound distrust of ourselves and our ability to tell true from false. We take no chances; we hide behind a timorous notion of reason, worn like sensible shoes.\nThis is, finally, the failing of so many current prescriptions for the national malaise. On the one hand, those on the right would retreat to rigid orthodoxies as sources of order. On the other hand, those who count themselves liberals place their faith in the processes of reason without content.11 Both responses embrace an idea of civility, but neither comprehends the role of continuing radical opposition in maintaining cultural definition, the need to aerate the roots of society by means that involve some violence to the soil. And the question must be raised as to whether we have not lost some of the richness of our traditions by condescending to the faith on which they were based. We have lost twice, because we can neither fully appreciate the motives that impelled some to speak as prophets, "},"document":{"title":"The Prophetic Tradition and Radical Rhetoric in America","author":"James Darsey","publisher":"New York University Press","id":75,"isbn":"9780814718766"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":30370,"display_name":"civility -- misplaced value of"},"id":77006,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30535,"display_name":"fire (as radical metaphor) -- \"fire and strength\""},"id":77275,"ring_next":20115,"ring_prev":20326},{"basket":{"id":30615,"display_name":"Hellenism, Matthew Arnold's conception of"},"id":77417,"ring_next":20124,"ring_prev":20319},{"basket":{"id":30956,"display_name":"reason -- as civility"},"id":77985,"ring_next":20154,"ring_prev":20154},{"basket":{"id":30959,"display_name":"reason -- liberal view of"},"id":77990,"ring_next":20126,"ring_prev":20126}],"localid":"page_209","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch10.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_209\">","css_selector":"#page_209","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_209\"]"},"next_location_id":20328,"previous_location_id":20326}]
