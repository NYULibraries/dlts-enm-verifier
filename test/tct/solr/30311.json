Ch’oe, in other words, embodied the sort of nostalgia for colonial sophistication that animated the seryŏn imagination described above. At the same time, in films like Hellflower and It’s Not Her Sin, she projected a persona that was clearly inflected by the brash sexuality and mystique of the Hollywood leading lady. Yet, unlike Kim Chŏng-rim, who rose briefly with her leading role in Madame Freedom, or Kim Ŭi-hyang, whose career, as we have seen, was a short-lived cycle of one-dimensional sexpot roles, Ch’oe Ŭn-hŭi’s career endured precisely because of the multiplicity of meanings—a kind of productive dissonance—contained in her body. And these found their fullest expression in the films here in a way that made the films a powerful conduit for fantasizing the possibilities of modernity.\nThe epitome of this productive dissonance is projected in Tongsimch’o. Ch’oe plays Madame Yi, a single mother widowed by the war who is torn between at least three poles: the memory of her husband and the social customs that relationship entails; the material and ethical debt she owes to Kim Sang-gyu, who bailed her out of a difficult financial situation; and the desire they mutually share for each other that is muted beneath those obligations. The action centers around a grand house in the affluent Seoul neighborhood of Hyehwa, both the site for and object of Yi’s conflicts, which is contrasted to the modern world of busy streets and bustling offices that is associated with her daughter on the one hand, and the timeless countryside home in Choch’iwŏn that is a station of family and tradition on the other. The narrative is in many ways similar to The Houseguest and My Mother (Sarangbang sonnim kwa ŏmŏni, 1961), a film Shin would direct two years later and with which Ch’oe would be closely identified, but is distinguished precisely in the mode by which this archetypal yeŭi vs. chŏng (duty vs. feeling) conflict is played out. Where the conflict in Houseguest exists at the interpersonal level between the neo-Confucian ties that bind the mother to her late husband and mother-in-law, on the one hand, and the romantic longings that connect her to the houseguest, on the other, the conflict in Tongismch’o is configured more explicitly at the social level, between the forces that enclose Madame Yi into her roles as widow and mother (the old mansion, the rural home) and the new material venues (the retail business venture, the sale of the old mansion) that promise to release Yi from her social bondage. For, despite the fact that she is dressed in the traditional hanbok and sports conservatively parted hair in every scene, Yi is in fact "},"document":{"title":"Split Screen Korea","author":"Steven Chung","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","id":110,"isbn":"9781452941516"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":44870,"display_name":"Confucianism -- conflicts with"},"id":112076,"ring_next":30326,"ring_prev":30364},{"basket":{"id":44992,"display_name":"Han Hyŏng-mo -- Madame Freedom"},"id":112539,"ring_next":30316,"ring_prev":30300},{"basket":{"id":45002,"display_name":"Hollywood films -- leading ladies"},"id":112570,"ring_next":30297,"ring_prev":30297},{"basket":{"id":45011,"display_name":"Houseguest and My Mother, The (film, Shin)"},"id":112608,"ring_next":30330,"ring_prev":30243},{"basket":{"id":45067,"display_name":"Kim Ŭi-hyang"},"id":112783,"ring_next":30312,"ring_prev":30312},{"basket":{"id":1363,"display_name":"modernity"},"id":112973,"ring_next":30374,"ring_prev":29662},{"basket":{"id":18708,"display_name":"patriotism"},"id":113238,"ring_next":30358,"ring_prev":30279},{"basket":{"id":45235,"display_name":"seryŏn, use of term"},"id":113505,"ring_next":30458,"ring_prev":30306},{"basket":{"id":45237,"display_name":"sexuality -- Ch'oe Ŭn-hŭi's projection of"},"id":113513,"ring_next":30313,"ring_prev":30314},{"basket":{"id":45308,"display_name":"Tongsimch'o (film, Shin)"},"id":113797,"ring_next":30312,"ring_prev":30308},{"basket":{"id":45329,"display_name":"women -- modern"},"id":113873,"ring_next":30313,"ring_prev":30289}],"localid":"page_73","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/xhtml/chapter2.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"pg_73\"/>","css_selector":"#pg_73","xpath":"a[@id=\"pg_73\"]"},"next_location_id":30312,"previous_location_id":30310}]
