The rib cage so prominently displayed as we enter suggests skeletons and imprisonment (a cage), and jars of poison sit out on the tabletop beneath it. The holographic toy that morphs a rose into a skull also fits the persona being developed. As for clues, there is only the blue page waiting for us on the bed, and one half of a note in one of the drawers of the map cabinet. Visitors to other Ages will also have similar impressions of Sirrus and Achenar based on the contents of their rooms, but the sons and their father, along with the frame story, will be discussed in a later section.\nWith either the red or blue page in hand (since only one can be carried at a time), the player is ready to return to Myst Island. Draining the lighthouse, however, gives us access to a wooden staircase spiraling down the wall, at the bottom of which we find a large wooden trunk. It can't be moved, only drained by a spigot on its side. And that's all there is to do. At this point we have encountered one of Myst's environmental puzzles, perhaps the best kind of puzzle found in the game. Unlike the puzzles involving machines or written clues, they involve problem-solving that requires the player's knowledge of how the conditions of the environment can be manipulated (for example, turning on or off the lights, draining water, turning on a heater, and so on). These puzzles are the most integrated into the game's world, and will often make use of things that do not appear to be part of a puzzle (like the light switch in the planetarium), which make them more difficult and more elegant in their simplicity. The lighthouse puzzle requires players to consider that the drained wooden chest will float, so the player must drain the chest, close the spigot, and then flood the lighthouse, to bring the chest up to the key. Even if the player realizes the chest may float, there is little reason to do so unless the connection is made between the lock on the chest and the key chained to the walkway above, which the player may have already mentally connected to the lock at the top of the ladder. Such misdirection and artful use of simple things combine into nice puzzles that can be quite hard to solve yet seem simple in retrospect. (Another such puzzle appears in the Rime Age, at a point where there seems to be little that the player can do.)\nOnce the chest is opened, the key inside can be used to unlock the overhead hatchway. The key and the lock both drop away and fall into the water. And sure enough, if the lighthouse is drained again, there they are on the ground at the bottom of the staircase; a little extra detail that can be easily missed by players (in the original version of Myst, the key can even be"},"document":{"title":"Myst and Riven: The World of the D'ni","author":"Wolf, Mark J.
