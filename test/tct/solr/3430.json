Certain enclosed locations, like the bedrooms or the underground chamber near the dock, even had ambient music that could be heard faintly as one approached the room.\nAs in film and television, sounds of off-screen events also help to create the sense of a surrounding space where events continue to happen even though the viewer or player is no longer there. In Cosmic Osmo, for example, when the player drops the carrot off-screen down into the room in which Se√±or Osmollo is encountered, we hear the sound of it hitting him on the head, and then the sound of him eating it. Or in the test tube lab, when the player drops a test tube off-screen, we hear the crash as it shatters on the floor (eliminating the need for an on-screen animation of the event as well). In Myst, sounds of off-screen events gained importance as clues. The metallic clanking of the tower rotation, the bubbling water sound of the sunken ship being raised, and the periodic ka-thunk of the tree elevator going up or down all occur initially as off-screen sounds that the player must investigate.\nAnother idea developed particularly in Cosmic Osmo and Myst is that of distant consequences arising from the player's actions. In Cosmic Osmo, whatever the player draws on the canvas set up on the easel inside the Vegetable Moon will later appear on the canvas hanging in Osmo's den inside the Holy Mackeral. Likewise, the programming the player sets at the KSMO station will later appear on Osmo's handheld television and the TV window on the Macintosh, and the message on an animated text display can be rewritten by the player elsewhere in the game. While none of these things is necessary for the playing of the game, since there is no real objective or goal, Myst used the separation of action and consequence to much greater effect, requiring players to figure out how to power and operate machinery or gain access to certain restricted areas. In Cosmic Osmo, all of the technology encountered has a clear purpose, which most often is simply an entertaining bit of animation and sound effects. Myst, on the other hand, often features buttons, levers, and the like, which appear to do nothing at all when activated, offering neither entertainment nor useful, obvious functionality. Such apparent uselessness, however, often does effectively create an enigma, giving the player a mystery to solve and a mini-objective to pursue.\n"},"document":{"title":"Myst and Riven: The World of the D'ni","author":"Wolf, Mark J.
