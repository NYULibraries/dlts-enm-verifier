John claimed that she never slept, but hummed about busily all night watching the hive. He also claimed that despite her enormous size, she spent much of her time invisible. This, he said, was why one rarely saw her, but heard stories about her simply showing up somewhere uninvited all the time.\nI met King Queen when she was not invisible. As I walked to the silverware dispenser in the Baker Refectory, I noticed people were looking my way quizzically. Instinctively, I turned my head to find John walking just a few inches away, dragging his feet, bobbing his head up and down with his tongue hanging out, and shaking his arms spastically, as I walked along in my normal state with sensible shoes, a straight back, and a flushed face. I whispered to John to stop it, but he continued doggedly on with contorted enthusiasm, convinced that the rest of the world was walking off-key.\nI bumped into something spongy with my tray, my silverware clattering to the floor. I gulped and looked straight up into King Queen’s pneumatic face. She smiled. She had one silver tooth and halitosis.\n“H . . . Hi,” I stammered.\n“Hehe, fancy bumping into you like this,” John drooled from behind my back.\nI tried to elbow him, spilling both glasses of milk onto my tray, but I didn’t dare look away from her smiling face, even though milk was seeping into my double-knit pants leg.\n“Excuse me,” she said with a deep, flirtatious rasp, tipping my tray with her gut as she exhaled all over me.\n“Why? You haven’t done anything yet,” John said from behind me.\n"},"document":{"title":"Indentation and Other Stories","author":"Joe Schall","publisher":"New York University Press","id":65,"isbn":"9780814779170"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_132","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch07.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_132\">","css_selector":"#page_132","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_132\"]"},"next_location_id":17549,"previous_location_id":17547}]
