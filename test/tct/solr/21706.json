Lesbian oppression is accomplished in part through rhetorical means, particularly the suppression of language and the denial of representations. However, when such suppression is no longer entirely effective, new language and representations, whether generated by opponents or proponents, can themselves further the cause of oppression. In addition, the language and images a group employs to portray its own struggle shape both the manner in which the group envisions its liberation and the ways in which its detractors formulate their opposition. By focusing on a marginalized group that has only recently begun to generate images and language that reach a public audience, this study reveals how choices about representation shape the possibilities for individual identity, group identity, and a liberatory vision. Those choices, at the same time, help define how a group articulates its struggles, its defeats, and its triumphs."},"document":{"title":"Freedom to Differ","author":"Diane Helene Miller","publisher":"New York University Press","id":80,"isbn":"9780814755969"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":32857,"display_name":"Language -- influence of"},"id":82608,"ring_next":21712,"ring_prev":21704},{"basket":{"id":32902,"display_name":"Lesbians -- oppression of"},"id":82735,"ring_next":21689,"ring_prev":21693},{"basket":{"id":29334,"display_name":"silence(ing)"},"id":83318,"ring_next":21780,"ring_prev":21700}],"localid":"page_37","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch1.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_37\">","css_selector":"#page_37","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_37\"]"},"next_location_id":21707,"previous_location_id":21705}]
