The latter were guided by Draža Mihailović (1893–1946) and his Chetnik movement. Although the Serbian Chetniks were nearly as nationalist as the Croatian Ustashe, they were also potential allies against the Germans. Yet there had been Serbian-Nazi collaboration, the extent of which only recently has been investigated in depth.30\nIn brief, my argument is that there have been two main pro-Serbian traditions in Britain: one was monarchical, pro-Chetnik, and anti-Titoist and was highlighted during the short period (September 1941–May 1943)31 in which British intelligence tried to underscore the extent of anti-Nazi resistance among the Serbs; the other was pro-Partisan and pro-Titoist, and emerged after British liaison officers were parachuted into Partisan-controlled areas to fight the Axis powers. In its Balkan campaign, London was faced with three options: support for the Chetniks, support for the Partisans, and the possibility of forging an unlikely alliance between the two against the Nazis. There were also proposals to divide the country into political areas.32 Thus “Mihailović should be supported in Serbia where he was thought to be strong, and the Partisans would be supported over the rest of the area. This remained SOE’s idea . . . until the end of 1943.”33 The Special Operation Executive (SOE) was an agency instituted in July 1940 with the aim of exploring all possible resistance against the Nazis in the Balkans and the Middle East, including support for guerrilla movements there. The SOE’s first mission in Yugoslavia was headed by Captain Duane Bill Hudson in September 1941. When the SOE was still attempting to co-opt the Serbs, the BBC was already campaigning for the Partisans, a fact that revealed deep divisions within Britain’s higher echelons. Before taking any decisions over which side to support in the war, Winston Churchill (1874–1965) appointed Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean (b. 1911) for a special surveillance mission in Yugoslavia “to go in and find out who was killing most Germans and how "},"document":{"title":"This Time We Knew","author":"Thomas Cushman","publisher":"New York University Press","id":99,"isbn":"9780814715352"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":41437,"display_name":"Chetnik movement"},"id":102547,"ring_next":28315,"ring_prev":28130},{"basket":{"id":41640,"display_name":"Marković, Mihailo"},"id":103062,"ring_next":28115,"ring_prev":28124},{"basket":{"id":41442,"display_name":"Partisans"},"id":103265,"ring_next":28163,"ring_prev":28163},{"basket":{"id":41461,"display_name":"Tito, Marshal Josip Broz"},"id":103541,"ring_next":28318,"ring_prev":28258}],"localid":"page_253","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch09.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_253\">","css_selector":"#page_253","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_253\"]"},"next_location_id":28314,"previous_location_id":28312}]
