Complementing the approach of the Newsreel films, Wexler was concerned with techniques that would privilege the object of protest. Echoing Godard’s Weekend (1967), the film opens and concludes with scenes of violent car crashes. Within Wexler’s film, images of violence are the correlative of a violent culture, evidence of which appears in scenes of gun practice at suburban rifle ranges and, most specifically, scenes of police rioting during the street demonstrations in Chicago. The film mixes cinema vérité-style documentary filmmaking with a realist fictional mode in such a way that fictional characters appear within scenes of real-life events at Chicago’s Grant Park and elsewhere. The aim here is, as David James has pointed out, to “demystify the Hollywood conventions of dramatic action and character … [and] to force the audience to identify less with the adventure or the hero and to think more about the documentary events.”19 Like the film Summer of ’68, Medium Cool contains a number of aleatory and self-reflexive moments; an example occurs when a tear-gas canister drops in front of a group of demonstrators and a voice on the sound track is heard to shout: “Watch out, Haskell, this is real!” At other times Wexler quite consciously reflects upon the implications and consequences of forms of representation. The opening car-crash scene, for example, questions the ethics of the news media by depicting a news camera team filming the accident before attending to the injuries of the victims. In another way, the mixture of documentary and fictional moments raises the issue of action determined by the presence of the camera. The demonstrators in Chicago knew that “the whole world is watching,” chanting the line to draw media attention to the actions of the police in the hope that the presence of television cameras would restrict excessive police violence. Ironically, the implication of the chant evokes the distortion of an historical moment by the intercession of the news media—a distortion critiqued in Medium Cool and Summer of ’68. Further, both films draw attention to the imbrication of power and representational forms. Specifically, the films intimate the ability of the popular media to justify a consensus on the Vietnam War through the delegitimation and marginalization of the voices of antiwar protest.\nContrasting with such depictions, other textual representations advanced an image of consesus by focusing on celebrities within the movement. A small number of people (notably Jane Fonda, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, and Jerry Rubin) has been privileged in textual accounts "},"document":{"title":"The Scar That Binds","author":"Keith Beattie","publisher":"New York University Press","id":78,"isbn":"9780814713266"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":31681,"display_name":"Democratic Party -- 1968 National Convention"},"id":79477,"ring_next":21203,"ring_prev":21127},{"basket":{"id":31696,"display_name":"documentary films"},"id":79519,"ring_next":21184,"ring_prev":21127},{"basket":{"id":31728,"display_name":"Fonda, Jane"},"id":79592,"ring_next":29291,"ring_prev":29291},{"basket":{"id":31743,"display_name":"Godard, Jean-Luc"},"id":79633,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":31772,"display_name":"Hayden, Tom"},"id":79705,"ring_next":21129,"ring_prev":21124},{"basket":{"id":31795,"display_name":"Hoffman, Abbie"},"id":79774,"ring_next":22778,"ring_prev":21124},{"basket":{"id":31830,"display_name":"James, David"},"id":79863,"ring_next":21188,"ring_prev":21114},{"basket":{"id":31891,"display_name":"Medium Cool"},"id":79999,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":31924,"display_name":"Newsreel (film collective)"},"id":80075,"ring_next":21127,"ring_prev":21127},{"basket":{"id":32002,"display_name":"Rubin, Jerry"},"id":80250,"ring_next":21129,"ring_prev":21124},{"basket":{"id":32058,"display_name":"Summer of ‘68"},"id":80362,"ring_next":21127,"ring_prev":21127},{"basket":{"id":32169,"display_name":"Weekend"},"id":80608,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":32173,"display_name":"Wexler, Haskell"},"id":80616,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_113","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch03.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_113\">","css_selector":"#page_113","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_113\"]"},"next_location_id":21129,"previous_location_id":21127}]
