[{"id":2842,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"14-page_25","content_descriptor":"page 25","text":"Blaze up into golden stones.\nI lean back, as the evening darkens and comes on.\nA chicken hawk floats over, looking for home.\nI have wasted my life.\nIn short, the poem records the process and the instant of ecstatic revelation. It therefore embodies the “noetic” quality James assigns to these encounters. The speaker—surely one is tempted to say Wright himself—contemplates his natural surroundings that appear both harmonious and capable of marvelous transformations that elude him. In the “shadow” world of mystical experience, a “bronze” butterfly can blow like a “leaf”; mere horse droppings may undergo a stunning alchemy and become “golden stones.” Even a chicken hawk floats over looking not for supper but for home (not “a home” but simply “home,” implying one awaits him). For a man lounging in a hammock at someone else’s farm, a husband and father like Wright enduring the pains of marital separation and eventual divorce from his hometown girl, the word “home” carries immense implications. Who’d not envy the natural harmony? Who’d not wish for the chance to transform the refuse of one’s life into gold? Who’d not suddenly realize the great waste of it and desire to put one’s life in harmony with natural if not spiritual order? The poem, then, is both the speaker’s celebration of numinous natural order and his statement of longing to align his life with it.\nThe difficulty in writing poetry of the ecstatic is overcoming what James calls the “ineffability” of the mystical experience. How to re-create within readers these “illuminations” when words seem inadequate to the task? Wright discovers one thing that keeps getting in his way: the Neoclassical “rhetoric” of his earlier mode. On a March 6, 1962, draft of an unpublished poem, “Two Images of One Place,” Wright confesses: “It occurs to me that my first . . . letter to the Blys was a cry of longing: ‘What must I do to be saved?’ Answer: ‘Cut the rhetoric.’ Okay, I fight on.” Here’s that strategy enacted in an unpublished September 3, 1960, draft of what was then titled “Lying in a Hammock at Pine Island, Minnesota.” The penciled-in strikethroughs actually appear in Wright’s typescript draft.21\n \nThe monarch butterfly sleeping against the pine branch\nIs changing to dark green bronze.\nAt the end of the ravine behind Duffy’s house\n"},"document":{"title":"Poetry's Afterlife: Verse in the Digital Age","author":"Stein, Kevin","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":14,"isbn":"9780472026708"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":4381,"display_name":"Aguilar, George -- \"Blackbirds\""},"id":12764,"ring_next":2843,"ring_prev":2942},{"basket":{"id":4443,"display_name":"Bly, Robert"},"id":12877,"ring_next":2846,"ring_prev":2836},{"basket":{"id":4546,"display_name":"Eliade, Mircea, on the profane and sacred"},"id":13052,"ring_next":2845,"ring_prev":2851},{"basket":{"id":858,"display_name":"Owen, Wilfred"},"id":13585,"ring_next":2931,"ring_prev":801},{"basket":{"id":4921,"display_name":"Sampling, poetic technique of"},"id":13727,"ring_next":2941,"ring_prev":2941},{"basket":{"id":5070,"display_name":"Wright, James -- \"Lying in a Hammock at Pine Island, Minnesota\" (unpublished draft)"},"id":14008,"ring_next":2843,"ring_prev":2843},{"basket":{"id":5085,"display_name":"Wright, James -- \"Two Images of One Place\" (unpublished draft)"},"id":14035,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_25","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap2.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_25\">","css_selector":"#page_25","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_25\"]"},"next_location_id":2843,"previous_location_id":2841}]
