The story points to themes found in analogous tales. Man deludes himself when he thinks that in controlling nature by erecting social structures he must now sustain, he has taken the final step toward resolving the essential conflicts in his domestic life. The husband who saves his wife by burning the effigy left as a substitute by the fairies, for example, is matched by the one who lays his sword across the supernatural folk who took his wife. Often mined and subsequently forged raw metals symbolize the triumph of patriarchal civilization. (It will be remembered that the Norwegian huldre wife driven beyond endurance by her husband’s abuse is able to bend an iron rod, undermining the man’s power over her.)44 To defeat the fairies with forged metals is comparable to the exorcism that banishes demon lovers, to the maiming of the animal or the burning of her skin, and the distinction between rescuing and controlling the woman collapses. What is extraordinary in the aboriginal tale is the extent to which the narrator sees the vicious cycle perpetuated, and the extent to which he recognizes that it creates a situation before which the ineffectual husband is helpless—“Manbuk come too late now”—doomed by his ambivalent relationship to his wife.\nJack Zipes has argued that central to most folktales is the “concept of power. Where does it reside? Who wields it? Why? How can it be better wielded?” From a contemporary perspective, folktales “are filled with incidents of explicable abuse, maltreatment of women, negative images of minority groups, questionable sacrifices, and the exaltation of power.”45 Zipes’s argument appears to require a political content folk narratives do not always disclose; nevertheless, on the psychological level, power also operates as a significant factor in the way people orient themselves in their societies. In three variants of the same tale from India, a husband’s attempt to win his fairy wife from the demon ruler of the other-world sets in motion a struggle between the wedded pair in which retaining his wife clearly necessitates the husband’s destroying in her what the demon lover represents. A comparison of the three versions reveals that although the stories conclude with the same outcome, the reconciliation of the separated pair, significantly varying degrees of power wielded by the Orpheus character over the swan maiden underscore the significance of power itself as a central theme in the narratives.\nThe consequences of a prince falling in love with a fairy rather than "},"document":{"title":"In Search of the Swan Maiden","author":"Barbara Fass Leavy","publisher":"New York University Press","id":37,"isbn":"9780814751008"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":14582,"display_name":"Zipes, Jack"},"id":42658,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_257","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch07.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_257\">","css_selector":"#page_257","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_257\"]"},"next_location_id":8932,"previous_location_id":8930}]
