Philip May's Love: The Reward, an 1885 novel also featuring a female nihilist named Vera, is typical in this regard. May's nihilist heroine is of noble birth but has been shut up in a convent for most of her girlhood, like Charlotte Corday: “She was a little Cinderella, who had come from the convent instead of from the kitchen” (1:144). Wilde's play, predating all of the aforementioned texts, takes greater political risk in providing Vera with peasant origins, alienating her further than a woman of higher birth from audience sympathies and from means of political access.\nWe learn early in the drama, for example, that Vera's brother Dmitri became a nihilist while being educated in the Russian metropolis of Moscow; Vera, in contrast, is left in the rural wilds, where she is expected to milk cows and marry her peasant neighbor. That she exhibits interests in politics and ethics is surprising and peculiar to those around her. As the prologue of the play opens, Vera's father, Peter Sabouroff, and her would-be suitor Michael discuss whether Vera will ever agree to marry. The root of her intransigence, they believe, is that she has “too many ideas,” too much “seriousness,” and “is always thinking of others” (120–22). Vera's expansive intellect and sympathy, it seems, are preventing her from settling comfortably into her domestic lot as a woman. In Vera's first appearance in the prologue, upon returning home and hearing Michael's plea for her love, she says that “there is so much else to do in the world but love” (125). Vera's resistance to love and marriage pointedly link her to a burgeoning discourse of female autonomy in 1880s Britain.24\nBy act 1, despite pressure to marry and stay home, Vera has become the most feared nihilist in Russia. Her femininity and lesser physical strength have not hindered her effectiveness in this sphere: the nihilist goal of assassinating the Czar, she says, could just as easily be accomplished by a woman as a man: “Oh, to think what stands between us and freedom in Europe! a few old men, wrinkled, feeble, tottering dotards whom a boy could strangle for a ducat, or a woman stab in a night-time” (150–51). This line articulates one of the most feared aspects of terrorism: the idea that political crime put the sort of national or public influence usually limited to the state into the hands of rogue individuals. James's and Conrad's novels refute this notion of terror by depicting utterly inept revolutionists, but in making his nihilist a woman, Wilde instead underscores the idea that political crime gives power and influence to otherwise insignificant individuals, which correlates it with democracy as a political force.\n"},"document":{"title":"Framed: The New Woman Criminal in British Culture at the Fin de Siecle","author":"Elizabeth Carolyn Miller","publisher":"University of Michigan Press and University of Michigan Library","id":29,"isbn":"9780472024469"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":7548,"display_name":"class"},"id":24299,"ring_next":6175,"ring_prev":6170},{"basket":{"id":7560,"display_name":"Conrad, Joseph"},"id":24361,"ring_next":6181,"ring_prev":6168},{"basket":{"id":7563,"display_name":"Conrad, Joseph -- Secret Agent"},"id":24391,"ring_next":6181,"ring_prev":6169},{"basket":{"id":7566,"display_name":"Corday, Charlotte"},"id":24450,"ring_next":6177,"ring_prev":6163},{"basket":{"id":7591,"display_name":"democracy / democratization"},"id":24573,"ring_next":6178,"ring_prev":6168},{"basket":{"id":7608,"display_name":"domestic sphere"},"id":24672,"ring_next":6181,"ring_prev":6112},{"basket":{"id":4672,"display_name":"James, Henry"},"id":25410,"ring_next":6189,"ring_prev":6168},{"basket":{"id":7808,"display_name":"May, Philip -- Love: The Reward"},"id":25636,"ring_next":6221,"ring_prev":6221},{"basket":{"id":7777,"display_name":"state, the"},"id":26351,"ring_next":6175,"ring_prev":6170}],"localid":"page_198","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/15_chap05.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_198\">","css_selector":"#page_198","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_198\"]"},"next_location_id":6173,"previous_location_id":6171}]
