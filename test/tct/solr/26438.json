Critical social theory enabled these scholars to rethink the fundamentals of Western thought. The critical interpretive strategies of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Fredric Jameson, Edward Said, and others helped precipitate a crisis in confidence over the validity of the canons of interpretation in both the fine arts and in academia. This crisis in confidence concerned the credibility of the traditional canons of interpretation for defining and categorizing knowledge and professional technique. It was only a matter of time until these academic trends in the university would be felt in the law schools.4\nIt is only now becoming clear that the current malaise and crisis in legal thought is shared by a wide range of intellectual thinkers, involving a variety of subjects and disciplines in the university. This common condition represents what social commentators call “a crisis of representation” or, more accurately, a series of crises of representation. The older modes of defining, appropriating, and evaluating the objects of artistic, philosophical, literary, and social sciences were no longer credible because the boundary between subjects and their objects had dissolved; this has, in turn, resulted in exciting new possibilities as the plurality of theoretical perspectives and interpretive practices have developed.5 The crisis of representation, known as postmodernism, has reached the legal academy and it is represented by a new form of postmodern jurisprudence.6\nThere is a rising sentiment in the legal academy that modern legal theory has failed to sustain the modernists’ hopes for social progress. Contemporary legal academics are becoming more cynical and skeptical as they realize that legal theorists have been participating in a “recycling process” in which “[e]ach [new] generation … offers a different metatheory to explain or understand legal phenomena, rejecting the perspectives of the previous generation in the hope of more successfully solving [law’s] paradox.”7 Cynicism comes with the realization that each succeeding generation of modern legal scholars has merely recycled the work of the previous generation, moving from new and improved conceptual theories to increasingly more complex normative theories, without ever achieving a successful conceptual or normative theory that "},"document":{"title":"Postmodern Legal Movements","author":"Gary Minda","publisher":"New York University Press","id":93,"isbn":"9780814755112"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":38847,"display_name":"Crisis of representation"},"id":96666,"ring_next":26195,"ring_prev":26251},{"basket":{"id":1123,"display_name":"Derrida, Jacques"},"id":96727,"ring_next":26562,"ring_prev":26420},{"basket":{"id":9640,"display_name":"Foucault, Michel"},"id":96852,"ring_next":26556,"ring_prev":26420},{"basket":{"id":39044,"display_name":"Jurisprudence -- postmodern"},"id":97388,"ring_next":26191,"ring_prev":26413},{"basket":{"id":2404,"display_name":"Said, Edward W."},"id":97503,"ring_next":1519,"ring_prev":26420}],"localid":"page_249","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch13_con.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_249\">","css_selector":"#page_249","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_249\"]"},"next_location_id":26439,"previous_location_id":26437}]
