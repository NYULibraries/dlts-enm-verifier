Its founding was a response to Detroit's condition as a place where contemporary art was intensively produced, but also where public venues for exhibiting this art were lacking. While the institutionalization of art often implies a stifling of creativity, initiative and vision, the Contemporary Art Institute of Detroit assayed a critical institutionalization, a deployment of institutionality against the grain by a self-organized artists' collective dedicated to the production of new connections between art and community.\nFor its first twenty-five years of existence, the Institute functioned nomadically, organizing and curating exhibitions and installations at a series of public sites throughout Detroit. In 2004, the Institute took over a building that was occupied by Detroit Contemporary, a gallery in operation from 1998 to 2003 that was co-founded by artists Aaron Timlin and Phaedra Robinson, founder of the Center for Creative eXchange.\n"},"document":{"title":"The Unreal Estate Guide to Detroit","author":"Herscher, Andrew","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":15,"isbn":"9780472029174"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_268","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/pt04_chp03.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_268\">","css_selector":"#page_268","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_268\"]"},"next_location_id":3355,"previous_location_id":3353}]
