She would like to be happier, and she would like to be successful in her career, but health problems (she insists) hold her back. As Freud gains Lisa’s trust he comes to learn of two recurring hallucinations—images of fires and storms—that plague Lisa’s mental life and weaken her health. Lisa typically experiences these visions when she and her husband are sexually intimate. Lisa is not eager to talk about these problems, but her life has become so tortured that she is desperate for relief. Lisa has excluded much of importance from her life, and her recurrent hallucinations insist that which is excluded be given voice and presence.\nSeeking to understand the hallucination-charged consciousness of Lisa, Thomas’s Freud considers, “What she had in her consciousness was only a secret and not a foreign body.”60 Lisa can see her own imagery only as a malignant force that pushes its way into consciousness in order to torment her, but Freud sees the imagery as a clue to a puzzle. He suggests:\nIn a sense . . . her mind was attempting to tell us what was wrong; for the repressed idea creates its own apt symbol. The psyche of an hysteric is like a child who has a secret, which no one must know, but everyone must guess.61\nAs Freud helps Lisa to remember her past and understand her mental life, Lisa is drawn to produce two literary compositions, a poem and a surrealistic autobiographical narrative. These literary works express a flood of imagery. There are fires and storms in these works, but these images are not frightening in this context. The aesthetic context of Lisa’s writing is in fact much like the context of psychoanalysis. It is a safe protected space, narcissistic and regressive, but it is also an experimental space where libidinal organizations that cause conflict can be safely expressed and considered. Lisa is able to imagine this space “inside” her because she has already experienced this space in her transference response to Freud, who listens to her as an interested ally in her experiences of conflict.\nThe literary works show that Lisa’s imagery of fire and storm is related to a system of emotional relationships that need more careful attention. Later in therapy Lisa wants to destroy her writing because they are “devilish fragments thrown off by the ‘storm inside her head.’ “62Freud, however, encourages Lisa to pay attention to her imagery, and as "},"document":{"title":"Narcissism and the Literary Libido","author":"Marshall W.
