The Jewish Endowment takes care of us. I spend months with my ninety-year-old father, some of the last months of his life. I spend Rosh Hashana at a strange synagogue. Ben learns Hebrew at Beth Israel where my friends from childhood studied for their Bat and Bar Mitzvahs. The days are short. In October my brother Andy and I travel to New Orleans and gut my house.\nAmelia escapes out of the back of my parents' house while we are gone. Gut.\n\nEVACUATION\nIt is cold in Alexandria, Virginia in October.Amelia. Amelia. Here Kitty Kitty Kitty. It's Mommy. Ben and I make flyers of her face on a piece of paper; I remember I have a colored photo of her on the computer that Mark brought up from the house his first trip back. We make two hundred copies. I spend one morning of many putting flyers in the mailboxes of the houses behind Martha's Circle where the Thorpe Estate used to be, where my brother Charlie got arrested in the sixties with his long Jewish Afro and hippy pants with the purple stripe for loitering. The flyers say Lost Cat. Evacuated from Katrina. Cat lost in Hollin Hills.I spread our evacuation all over the neighborhood.I run between houses because I have so little time.I run because I can.I run because I have so much adrenaline pumping through my body.I could have run ten marathons. I ran and ran and ran and have never stopped.\n\nEVACUATION\nEpilogue\nIn the community of beautiful Japanese-style houses the trees gathered their tentacle branches and ate my Amelia as fiercely as they gathered me in their arms and kept me sane. We drove home on December 23 in time for Christmas with Granny and Papa in Baton Rouge. As Ben and I sped through Slidell and New Orleans East I made sure that we listened to WWOZ blare their silly Christmas songs, and I cried silently in the front seat so that Ben would not grow up too fast as we passed mile after mile of darkened silence where communities used to stand.\n\n\n"},"document":{"title":"Civic Engagement in the Wake of Katrina","author":"Amy Koritz and George J.
