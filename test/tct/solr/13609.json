Though a theory of property has implications for taxation, it is hardly a full-blown theory of taxation. The distinction functions as a set-aside rather than a dodge. Second, in some instances taxes on income and wealth may amount to a taking. Examples are a gross receipts tax set so high that it destroys a business or a property tax on Indian real estate that was exempted by treaty from land taxes.5 It may be difficult to say whether these taxes are illegitimate, or, though legitimate, are takings. Anyway, there is not always a clear line between taxes and takings. Third, if one thinks that a legitimate tax can have a redistributive purpose, then one might allow that a taking could also have such a purpose. In fact, most takings that occur in the United States lack any clear redistributive purpose. And even if a taking were intended to redistribute, it would not follow that it would be a tax. But if redistribution is sometimes legitimate, and if takings can redistribute, then one cannot rule out certain takings simply on the ground that they aim to redistribute income or wealth. Contextual factors determine whether taxation is a less intrusive, more efficient, or morally better means of redistribution than takings. So even if as a general matter taxes on income and wealth are preferred means, this will not always be so. In a country with grossly unjust and disproportionate land holdings, land reform measures classifiable as takings may be in order,6 and no moral or political justification may exist for providing full, or perhaps any, compensation.\nI am, then, concerned with government action that adversely affects private property rights7 in external things, prescinded from issues of taxation. Sometimes the government may acknowledge such impact, as when it condemns private land by eminent domain to build a school. At other times it may dispute the impact or at least any duty to compensate, as when it conserves wetlands or preserves architectural landmarks.\n2. OUTLINE OF A THEORY\nA theory of property rights sheds much light on the moral and political problem of takings. For reasons that I give elsewhere,8 the most satisfactory theory of property is a pluralist theory that "},"document":{"title":"Compensatory Justice","author":"John W.
