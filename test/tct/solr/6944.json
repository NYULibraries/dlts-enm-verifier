As the sensor capacities of these devices are developed, their ability to note their location in absolute terms as well as in terms of proximity to similar devices will become highly accurate and widespread. And given the personal nature of these devices, detecting them is a reasonable proxy for detecting a person, with some useful levels of precision. In some cases, existing widespread technologies like Bluetooth and WiFi, while suboptimal for a variety of technical reasons, provide an already broadly available base for devices to sense the presence of one another. Wireless devices can be programmed to monitor the ongoing stream of passing equipment like themselves, each of which is often provided with a unique identifier. When these data are stored and analyzed, the result is a self-documenting social world in which casual encounters are noted with the same detail as long-term relationships. Projects like the Jabberwocky system from Intel Research, along with commercial systems like nTAG and Spotme, explore this implicit hypertie concept.4 These and other related projects and products are described in the next section of this essay.\nWhen mobile devices are widespread, social ties can be authored and inscribed in a number of ways, most of which are passive and without explicit intervention by the participants. Machines accomplish this sensing in two broad ways; they can directly link to one another, sensing the presence of other radios, light beacons, or sound sources. Alternatively, machines can independently determine their location using a variety of technologies—from GPS to terrestrial radio and other location beacons—and can share that information with a common repository such that their proximity can be calculated from the joint data set and reported back to the mobile devices.\nHypertie Systems\nHere are capsule descriptions of early examples of hypertie systems.\n"},"document":{"title":"The Hyperlinked Society: Questioning Connections in the Digital Age","author":"Turrow, Joseph; Tsui, Lokman","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":32,"isbn":"9780472024537"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":9544,"display_name":"Bluetooth"},"id":30531,"ring_next":6946,"ring_prev":6899},{"basket":{"id":6919,"display_name":"cell phones"},"id":30598,"ring_next":6962,"ring_prev":6928},{"basket":{"id":9715,"display_name":"Jabberwocky"},"id":31078,"ring_next":6946,"ring_prev":6946},{"basket":{"id":9774,"display_name":"MP3 players"},"id":31262,"ring_next":6778,"ring_prev":6778},{"basket":{"id":9806,"display_name":"Ntag"},"id":31485,"ring_next":6847,"ring_prev":6847},{"basket":{"id":9833,"display_name":"Personal digital assistant (PDA)"},"id":31536,"ring_next":6946,"ring_prev":6778},{"basket":{"id":9916,"display_name":"Spotme"},"id":31828,"ring_next":6946,"ring_prev":6847},{"basket":{"id":7403,"display_name":"videos"},"id":31980,"ring_next":6949,"ring_prev":6936},{"basket":{"id":9973,"display_name":"Wifi"},"id":32043,"ring_next":6997,"ring_prev":6894}],"localid":"page_169","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap11.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_169\">","css_selector":"#page_169","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_169\"]"},"next_location_id":6945,"previous_location_id":6943}]
