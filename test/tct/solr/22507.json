To care for them cannot simply be a biomedical task. HIV/AIDS caregivers must care for the entirety of a woman’s being.\nWhile programs of the early epidemic focused primarily on white gay males (Novello, 1993; Rosser, 1991), the increasing impact of HIV disease on women has necessitated a rethinking of our response to the disease (Health Resources and Services Administration, 1995).\nThrough June 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 78,654 AIDS cases in adolescent and adult females in the United States. This represents 14.5 percent of this country’s cumulative total of AIDS cases in these age groups (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1996). It is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in women, especially those of childbearing age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1995; Quinn, 1995).\n"},"document":{"title":"HIV Mental Health for the 21st Century","author":"Mark G.
