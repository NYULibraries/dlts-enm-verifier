When his crimes are committed in, as Pegeen says, their “back yard,” the villagers’ own complicity becomes too apparent for their superegos to tolerate. They then undergo a shift from the id’s delight in an act of aggression against authority to the superego’s denunciation of the same act.\nOn a deeper level, we can view the villagers’ persecution of Christy not as a gratification of the superego following a gratification of the id, but rather as a compromise formation: behavior that simultaneously gratifies both sides of their inner conflict over criminality. For in branding and preparing to lynch Christy, the villagers themselves are behaving like criminals; they are acting outside the law. They are thus expressing their own sadistic and criminal impulses and also their defense against these impulses—their need to see themselves as opposed to crime. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then their illegal behavior represents admiration for criminals.\nAs in literature, so also in life: people may permit a breakthrough of their own antisocial impulses in the guise of bringing criminals to justice. For instance, in California in the early 1970s, government undercover agents intentionally and illegally slaughtered seven elk, sheep, and polar bears in the process of building a case against suspected hunting violators. The federal district judge who presided over the successful prosecution commented: “The fascinating aspect of this case is that the agents go out and kill these same animals that the defendant is charged with killing. They (the government) brought a road contractor all the way from Vermont to illegally kill animals. No matter what happens here, I am going to pursue this.”40 In the conventional view, such illegal behavior by prosecutors is a lamentable accident resulting from excessive zeal. From the perspective I am advocating, however, the phenomenon of prosecutors crossing over the line into illegality can best be understood as a foreseeable breakthrough of their repressed admiration for criminals.\nEven where there is not, as in the preceding examples, a breakthrough of criminal behavior on the part of the prosecutor, it may "},"document":{"title":"Romantic Outlaws, Beloved Prisons","author":"Martha Grace Duncan","publisher":"New York University Press","id":74,"isbn":"9780814718803"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":29638,"display_name":"Persecution -- as a compromise formation"},"id":76369,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":29667,"display_name":"Criminal -- as a stranger"},"id":76649,"ring_next":19931,"ring_prev":19931}],"localid":"page_113","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chapter09.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_113\">","css_selector":"#page_113","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_113\"]"},"next_location_id":19948,"previous_location_id":19946}]
