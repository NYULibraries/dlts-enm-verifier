In chapter 9 I consider the poems which, beginning with “Turning” (June 1914), show the evolution of an inner beloved woman or female presence. This process culminates in his transformation of Vera Knoop, a young dancer, artist, and musician, the daughter of friends, who had recently died at nineteen, into the inner woman, “almost a girl” (“fast ein Mádchen”), who inspired The Sonnets to Orpheus, as the poems, themselves, their dedication, and his letters about them tell us. In the second sonnet he imagines that she has made her bed within his ear and slept there and that her sleep within his “auditory imagination” included the world and brought it within him, allowing him at last to hear the Orphic lyre resounding in his ordinarily “unheard center.” (The “auditory imagination” is T. S. Eliot’s concept. “Unheard center” [“unerhórte mitte”] comes from the twenty-eighth sonnet of the second cycle, which is clearly about Vera, though she is not named, and which is dedicated to her.) With this figure in the Sonnets, with the silent, invisible female friend of the Seventh Duino Elegy, and with the beloved Earth in the Ninth Elegy, whom he imagines yearning to become invisible within him, Rilke brought to perfection his efforts to give vivid, compelling life and form to the loving, “mirroring” maternal figure, present in The Notebooks and in so many of his poems. In the young woman, “almost a girl,” of the Sonnets this mental presence found a disguise which concealed its real, felt meaning from the poet as well as his readers.\nBy giving such evocative, if disguised, forms of existence to the beloved maternal figure within him he was able to convert narcissistic illness into creative narcissism and to find in his isolation at Muzot the wholeness and fertile, potent self-sufficiency that made it possible for him to complete the Elegies and to write the Sonnets. The writing of the Sonnets and the final Elegies brought the psychological processes which I have described to completion.\nAlthough a number of biographies have been published, only one earlier book has answered the need for a psychological study of this great poet—Erich Simenauer’s Rainer Maria Rilke: Legende und Mythos, published in 1953 and never translated into English. I am indebted to Simenauer for his perceptive readings of Rilke’s works and his letters. But his book is limited by its narrow reliance on early Freudian concepts. His “classical” analysis focuses on the consequences of a “fixation” in the “oedipal stage” with its murderous hatred of the father and incestuous "},"document":{"title":"The Beginning of Terror","author":"David Kleinbard","publisher":"New York University Press","id":44,"isbn":"9780814746677"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":16277,"display_name":"\"Auditory imagination\""},"id":45540,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":16321,"display_name":"Creativity -- creative narcissism"},"id":45615,"ring_next":10959,"ring_prev":10977},{"basket":{"id":4547,"display_name":"Eliot, T.
