It checks the flight of the mystic, restrains the fancy of the poet, assuages the ardor of the ascetic, and recalls the fanatical dogmatist to the realities of life.\nIn Judaism, the unity of ethnic awareness and religious loyalty is fundamental and of a peculiar intimacy. Accordingly, we may expect to find the usual tensions of ethnicism and faith magnified and intensified, with the surge of idealism reaching occasionally peculiar heights even as from time to time the pathos of sacred egotism may sink to the lowest depths. As we turn our attention to the formative period of the Jewish mentality, we find the heights of objective thought and universal sympathy conjoined with intensified feelings of ethnic pride and religious exclusiveness.
