Kirk and Madsen argued that gay “misbehavior,” as they viewed it, was largely responsible for the failure of the LGB movement to reach the hearts of middle America. They advocated both a national advertising campaign to stress the similarities between LGBs and the rest of society, and changes in the personal lifestyles of LGBs (especially men) immersed in the urban subculture to better fit in with the societal norm.\nBawer later argued that LGB people living next door in the suburbs who looked, sounded, and acted just like their straight neighbors were far more psychologically threatening to heterosexual society than are flamboyant folk in feathers or leathers living in distant big cities who are seen by heterosexuals only on television in Gay Pride parades. Therefore, Bawer asserted, it was assimilated LGBs living and working and playing among their neighbors who would do the most difficult, and at length the most successful, work in breaking down ancient hatreds and fears and bringing about real equality.\n\nThere was a dramatic shift in philosophy and strategy following Stonewall from the essential assimilationism of the early homophile movement to the flamboyant radicalism of Gay Liberation, which asked for nobody’s permission to be whatever one was and demanded equality. In like manner, the assumptions of Gay Liberation were flipped on their head by the withdrawal of the lesbian feminists, who demanded a more fundamental challenge to what they saw as a fundamentally oppressive culture, not merely with respect to sexuality.\nThe community eventually grew back together in response to the AIDS crisis and political challenges from the right. Yet some of the old conflicts reemerged in new guises, especially that between the militant street activists of the late 1980s and early 1990s and the new assimilationists whose response it engendered. Between these poles were numerous national, state, and local LGB political organizations seeking to hold the movement (and, sometimes, themselves) together and change the country’s mind and heart at the same time.\nNine Hypotheses\nAt this point we can draw this long discussion together in the form of nine hypotheses, the questions to be answered to the extent possible with the empirical exit poll data in the succeeding chapters.\nIn doing this, I must note again the inherent disadvantages of the absence "},"document":{"title":"The Lavender Vote","author":"Mark Hertzog","publisher":"New York University Press","id":60,"isbn":"9780814735305"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":23866,"display_name":"Bawer, Bruce"},"id":63805,"ring_next":20294,"ring_prev":20310},{"basket":{"id":23958,"display_name":"Kirk, Marshall"},"id":64045,"ring_next":20302,"ring_prev":20302},{"basket":{"id":23977,"display_name":"Madsen, Hunter"},"id":64098,"ring_next":20302,"ring_prev":20302}],"localid":"page_47","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chp02.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_47\">","css_selector":"#page_47","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_47\"]"},"next_location_id":15810,"previous_location_id":15808}]
