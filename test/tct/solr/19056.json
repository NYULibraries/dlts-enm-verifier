In Dantes Divine Comedy (Inferno, XX), the fortunetellers, who spent their lives looking into the future—Gods prerogative—are condemned to spend eternity with their heads twisted so they can look only behind themselves and must therefore walk backwards.\n32. Friday was NCB’s salon day. The “other Mardrus” is Lucie Delarue-Mardrus, wife of the Orientalist Dr. J.-C. Mardrus; she was called “Princesse Amande” because her completely shaved body was as smooth and pale as an almond. For her translations of Poe, see the last notes in the chapter in Adventures devoted to her.\nLike Baudelaire, Mallarmé considered Poe his master in poetry. He translated The Raven (Le Corbeau) for a bilingual edition illustrated by Manet (1875), and wrote a sonnet, “Le Tombeau d’Edgar Poe” (“The Tomb of Edgar Poe”), published in 1877. His translations of Les Poèmes d’Edgar Poe appeared in 1888, 1926, and 1928.\n33. These words, given in English in Valéry’s letter, constitute the opening line of Poe’s poem “To Helen,” on Helen of Troy; its ninth and tenth lines recall “… the glory that was Greece / And the grandeur that was Rome.” Valéry wrote the sonnet “Hélène,” published in 1891.\n34.

The three pieces were reprinted in a volume entitled Les divers Essais sur Léonard de Vinci de Paul Valéry, commentes par lui-même (Miscellaneous Essays on Leonardo da Vinci by Paul Valéry, with his Comments) (printed 1931, offered for sale 1933), accompanied by marginal notes, written in 1929–30, and giving Valéry’s later attitudes toward his earlier writings on the subject.\n35. Poe’s Eureka: A Prose Poem (published 1848) is based on his readings in Newton, Laplace, and others. It accepts intuition, as well as induction and deduction, as legitimate paths to knowledge. Valéry, deeply affected by Poe’s works, notably Eureka, wrote an essay, “Au sujet d’Eureka,” for Introduction à Charles Baudelaire, Eureka, par Edgar Poe (1921); reprinted in La Revue Européenne 3 (1 May 1923): 6–18.\n"},"document":{"title":"Adventures of the Mind","author":"Natalie Clifford Barney, John Spalding Gatton","publisher":"New York University Press","id":71,"isbn":"9780814711774"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":27725,"display_name":"Adam, Juliette"},"id":71743,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":6078,"display_name":"Baudelaire, Charles"},"id":71995,"ring_next":19066,"ring_prev":18811},{"basket":{"id":27818,"display_name":"Berenson, Bernard"},"id":72024,"ring_next":18820,"ring_prev":19051},{"basket":{"id":27731,"display_name":"Delarue-Mardrus -- Lucie"},"id":72227,"ring_next":19063,"ring_prev":19053},{"basket":{"id":44303,"display_name":"Poe, Edgar Allan -- Eureka"},"id":72271,"ring_next":18889,"ring_prev":18889},{"basket":{"id":28028,"display_name":"Mallarmé, Stéphane"},"id":72686,"ring_next":19060,"ring_prev":19055},{"basket":{"id":28030,"display_name":"Joseph Charles Mardrus"},"id":72700,"ring_next":19064,"ring_prev":19053},{"basket":{"id":44331,"display_name":"Poe, Edgar Allan"},"id":72864,"ring_next":19057,"ring_prev":19036},{"basket":{"id":28092,"display_name":"Poe, Edgar Allan -- To Helen\""},"id":72870,"ring_next":18889,"ring_prev":18889},{"basket":{"id":28201,"display_name":"\"To Helen\" (Poe)"},"id":73214,"ring_next":18889,"ring_prev":18889},{"basket":{"id":4985,"display_name":"Valery, Paul"},"id":73255,"ring_next":19057,"ring_prev":19055}],"localid":"page_235","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/notes.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_235\">","css_selector":"#page_235","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_235\"]"},"next_location_id":19057,"previous_location_id":19055}]
