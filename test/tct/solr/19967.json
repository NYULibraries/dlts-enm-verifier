As the novelist John Fowles observes in his “Foreword” to the 1974 edition, “[T]he real black hound is the Moor itself.”50\nThe motif of evil as wet dirt did not appear for the first time in the nineteenth century. Rather, in his brilliant rendering of crime, Conan Doyle was drawing on a symbol with origins deep in the Judeo-Christian tradition. Thus, the sixteenth-century allegorist John Bunyan chose a slimy bog, the “Slough of Despond,” to represent evil in The Pilgrim’s Progress.51 Soon after the protagonist, Christian, flees his home in the City of Destruction to seek eternal life, he falls into a bog, becomes “grievously bedaubed with dirt,” and begins to sink. With the assistance of a man named Help, he struggles free of the bog, and then inquires why the hazard is not remedied, so that travellers might pass safely through the region. Help explains: “This miry slough is such a place as cannot be mended. It is the descent whither the scum and filth that attends conviction for sin doth continually run, and therefore it is called the Slough of Despond.”52 Like the witches’ brew in Macbeth, this slough serves as a receptacle of evil. More specifically, it symbolizes the state of moral turpitude into which an individual has sunk. This meaning has been captured beautifully in Webster’s New International Dictionary, which defines slough as “an engulfing depth of sin.”53\nWriting a thousand years before Bunyan, the Roman philosopher Boethius also conceived of evil as slime, in a line that some have translated: “Seest thou not then in what mire wickedness wallows . . . ?”54 By contrast, in Queen Elizabeth’s translation, this line reads: “See you not in what a great slowe . . . wicked things be wrapped in.”55 Here the queen makes a play on words. To the idea of evil encased in mud, she adds an allusion to the other meaning of slough: the outer skin that a reptile periodically sheds.\nThe metaphor of the criminal as a reptile or, more exactly, a "},"document":{"title":"Romantic Outlaws, Beloved Prisons","author":"Martha Grace Duncan","publisher":"New York University Press","id":74,"isbn":"9780814718803"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":29581,"display_name":"Boethius"},"id":75622,"ring_next":30528,"ring_prev":30586},{"basket":{"id":29603,"display_name":"Bunyan, John: The Pilgrim's Progress"},"id":75651,"ring_next":19972,"ring_prev":19972},{"basket":{"id":29614,"display_name":"Chance image"},"id":75668,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":29778,"display_name":"Fowles, John -- \"Foreword\" to The Hound of the Baskervilles"},"id":75947,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":29918,"display_name":"Macbeth, The Tragedy of (Shakespeare)"},"id":76210,"ring_next":19973,"ring_prev":19959},{"basket":{"id":29965,"display_name":"Network of images"},"id":76300,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30122,"display_name":"Shakespeare, William -- The Tragedy of Macbeth"},"id":76578,"ring_next":19973,"ring_prev":19959},{"basket":{"id":30135,"display_name":"Slough, defined"},"id":76597,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_133","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chapter10.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_133\">","css_selector":"#page_133","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_133\"]"},"next_location_id":19968,"previous_location_id":19966}]
