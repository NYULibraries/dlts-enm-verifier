Instead, they have become bona fide artists in the eyes of many of their peers.\nFor my male respondents, DJing serves as a potent source of status and prestige, providing an opportunity to socialize with peers, to meet young women, and to forge networks with other DJs. Echoing the remarks of Rey-Jun and Rygar above, Soup-a-Crunk describes the power and influence that comes with being a DJ:\n\nINTERVIEWER: People treat you differently because you’re a DJ?\nSOUP-A-CRUNK: Yes, they think you’re a rock star. No, I mean, really, it’s not that extreme. You know, like, most people know you’re a DJ, they’re super nice to you because they want you to deejay their party for cheap. You know, I’m like, “Hey, I heard this game before. Slow down. Put your brakes on.” In that aspect, yes, but then, you know, it’s not like I advertised myself as “Oh yeah, by the way, I’m a DJ.” It just happens. It’s just, like, I mean, I have mixtapes or whatever, but yeah. I mean, girls seem to like it too.\nINTERVIEWER: Talk about that.\nSOUP-A-CRUNK: It’s just, like, the idea. They think you know where the parties are, they think you know hella people, they think you know this DJ that DJ and they fucking want you to make mixtapes.9\n\nAs Soup-a-Crunk alludes to, Filipino DJs’ acquisition of subcultural capital is not just based on the kind of services they provide and the kind of skills they possess, but also on what these services and skills signify—connections to the right people, access to parties, and knowledge of the latest trends in music. In effect, involvement in DJing serves as a vehicle for Filipino youth to attain local celebrity status among peers.\nThe subcultural capital embodied by Filipino DJs also stems, in large part, on their ability to develop a distinctive style that revolves around a particular form of masculinity. In the face of limited means of expression, DJing constitutes one of the few arenas in which Pinoy youth find room to articulate a masculine ideal and publicly display styles of masculinity not generally associated with Filipino men. More specifically, Filipino DJs enact and embody a certain kind of masculinity built around the mastery of technical and musical skills. In their hands, turntables are transformed into musical instruments and, in particular, into sources of innovation and creativity that then serve as the basis of their gender identity. DJing, in other words, has become an important source of status and prestige among Filipino youth precisely because it serves as a vehicle for the production and performance of an emergent Filipino masculinity that resonates with many of them.\n"},"document":{"title":"FILIPINOS REPRESENT","author":"Antonio T.
