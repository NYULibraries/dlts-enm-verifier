Consequently, they tend to focus on different issues, arguments, and substantive topics.38 Matsuda argued that the legal elite of academia have established an illegitimate racial hierarchy that has subordinated the academic status of minority scholars.39 She argued that minority scholars are the ones the law should listen to since “[t]hose who have experienced discrimination speak with a special voice.”40\nThe emphasis on race consciousness in critical race scholarship has stimulated a call for stories from and about the experience of people of color. As a result of the new pedagogy of storytelling, a new form of narrative jurisprudence emerged within critical race scholarship. Like the narrative jurisprudence associated with the feminist and law and literature movements, which seeks to reveal the human potential missing in law, race-conscious narratives are offered to reveal the missing race consciousness of legal and social thought. Critical race scholars such as Derrick Bell, Richard Delgado, and Patricia Williams have used rich allegories, metaphors, chronicles, and parables to describe the experience of race discrimination from an African American perspective. Race narratives are another illustration of how “narrative jurisprudence” illuminates a particular experience left out of modern legal discourse.41\nThe “voice of color” is relevant because it gives importance to the "},"document":{"title":"Postmodern Legal Movements","author":"Gary Minda","publisher":"New York University Press","id":93,"isbn":"9780814755112"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":38866,"display_name":"Critical race theory -- exclusion thesis"},"id":96687,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":38875,"display_name":"Critical race theory -- racial distinctiveness theses"},"id":96697,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":5659,"display_name":"Delgado, Richard"},"id":96715,"ring_next":26364,"ring_prev":26360},{"basket":{"id":31356,"display_name":"Matsuda, Mari"},"id":97196,"ring_next":26364,"ring_prev":20613},{"basket":{"id":20490,"display_name":"race -- consciousness"},"id":97442,"ring_next":26364,"ring_prev":26360},{"basket":{"id":39268,"display_name":"Race narratives"},"id":97448,"ring_next":26368,"ring_prev":26345},{"basket":{"id":39271,"display_name":"Racial distinctiveness thesis"},"id":97452,"ring_next":26462,"ring_prev":26462},{"basket":{"id":39318,"display_name":"Storytelling -- critical race"},"id":97561,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":39336,"display_name":"Voice of color"},"id":97599,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":6047,"display_name":"Williams, Patricia"},"id":97638,"ring_next":26367,"ring_prev":26349}],"localid":"page_172","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch09.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_172\">","css_selector":"#page_172","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_172\"]"},"next_location_id":26362,"previous_location_id":26360}]
