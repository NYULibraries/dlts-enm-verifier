As I write this, thousands of advertising industry executives still don't understand why the Internet and hyperlinking are important. They think they know why, and most of them will spout off a few canned lines about “consumer control” when asked about the Web, but they often don't fully comprehend the weak explanations coming out of their own mouths.\nTo grasp how hyperlinking has changed the advertising business, one must accept two fundamental truths, one of which logically follows from the other:\n1. Hyperlinking has changed the fundamental dynamic of human communication.\n2. This change in dynamic has altered how advertising functions within the context of the communications landscape.\nThe first fundamental truth is something that quite a few people, both inside and outside of the advertising business, have trouble swallowing—and with good reason. It's an incredibly broad statement—the kind an MBA candidate might back up with a thesis paper hundreds of pages long. But it's certainly true.\nAllow me to illustrate with an example. A few years ago, I decided to make treasure hunting my new hobby. My family had given me a cheap metal detector from Radio Shack for my birthday that year, and I had some limited success with it on the beach near my house. One morning, I managed to uncover a small pile of change and some jewelry and was bitten by the bug. I was convinced that if I upgraded my metal detector and consulted some of my fellow treasure hunters, I might be more successful.\n"},"document":{"title":"The Hyperlinked Society: Questioning Connections in the Digital Age","author":"Turrow, Joseph; Tsui, Lokman","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":32,"isbn":"9780472024537"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":225,"display_name":"advertising"},"id":30315,"ring_next":6922,"ring_prev":6903},{"basket":{"id":8447,"display_name":"radio"},"id":31641,"ring_next":6915,"ring_prev":6905},{"basket":{"id":9855,"display_name":"Radio Shack"},"id":31652,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_137","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap08.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_137\">","css_selector":"#page_137","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_137\"]"},"next_location_id":6913,"previous_location_id":6911}]
