Yet he does this on the basis of experiments in which subjects feeling less concern for a victim proved less ready to help if they could more readily “escape” and avoid encountering the person again. However, his studies fell far short of encompassing the complexities of when, how, and with what personal effects one may feel a sense of shared identity with another person as a “we” (in the rich and enduring sense that Hornstein and others mean). It is therefore premature to suppose that he has ruled out motives in which the self/other distinction is partly dissolved.\nIt may be precisely the mental capacity to assimilate other persons to the subjective self that makes voluntary altruism possible, even when personal costs are psychologically salient, and attention is not exclusively other directed. Comparisons with other species do hint that human bio-altruistic dispositions can only extend beyond fitness constraints just because we are self-aware goal seekers. If so, a capacity to feel shared identities with other persons may be our most basic source of prosocial motivation. Until we attain a much deeper insight into relevant mental mechanisms, it is unwise to interpret the other-directed-concern criterion for authentic altruism too restrictively. Even the liberal, FI paradigm of sociobiology should lead us to look for a way in which nonegoistic motives can be seen to grow out of the egoism that we appear to be born with. It is now appropriate, therefore, to examine first the evolution and then the ontogenetic development of the self-system—including how social experience shapes how readily and extensively we can embrace others within it.\nTHE EVOLUTION OF SELF-AWARENESS\nOur subjective selves, as defined and individually accessible in awareness, are by no means isomorphic with our material organism, or bodily ego. It is also necessary to think of any immediate content of self-awareness as one of a number of introspectible selves, or one part or facet of a broader self-system of connected, but not always consistent processes. Conscious self-system goals can evidently go beyond or against the ego’s needs. Therefore, the claim that we are programmed to promote our “self-interest” above all else will mean quite different things when understood subjectively rather than materially—especially if the experienced self sometimes "},"document":{"title":"Embracing the Other","author":"Pearl M.
