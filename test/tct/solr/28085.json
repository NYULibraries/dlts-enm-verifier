Blitz notes in this volume, Serbia’s government agencies routinely disseminate propaganda advertisements as well as statements in the Western press—usually equating the Jews and Serbs as historical victims of Croats and Muslims, blaming all Muslims for their defeat at Kosovo in 1389, and insinuating that all contemporary Croats are Nazis.51 Such propaganda, as Daniel Kofman points out in his criticism of Israeli-Serbian relations in this volume, seem to be accepted by many leading Israeli intellectuals, media figures, and politicians. In his essay, Kofman notes that while diaspora Jews have responded outstandingly to the crisis in Bosnia, many Israeli elites, including intellectuals, have been indulgent of Serbia.\nBut throughout the West, what is surprising is the number of intellectuals and scholars at conferences who mouth these clearly noncredible (and incredible) slogans. At the 1994 meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies in Philadelphia, for instance, a panel on media coverage of the Balkan War included a presentation in which the presenter, a Serb, chastised the New York Times for its anti-Serb views, that is, for failing to point out that the Bosnian Serbs are allegedly victims of Croat-Muslim aggression. These very same views can also be found on elaborate home page displays on the internet’s World Wide Web. If, in fact, the New York Times did take an unequivocal position against the Serbs and their genocidal practices, we would be heartened, since it would prove our arguments about the lack of intellectual response to be either exaggerated or just plain wrong. Yet many key elements of Serbian propaganda have been adopted to a large extent by intellectuals, diplomats, and journalists, and these serve as further rationalizations that mitigate the responsibility of intellectuals. For instance, an editorial in the New York Times notes that “Croatia’s 20th century record of aggression and ethnic cleansing is every bit as bad as Serbia’s. Memories of the atrocities committed by Croatia’s fascist Ustashe regime against Serbs, Muslims, and Jews during World War II helped fuel the Serbian revolt in Krajina four years ago.”52 What is most striking about this statement is not only that it equates Croatian actions with those of the past, but that it so clearly resonates with the central themes of Serbian propaganda, which rely on the principle of intergenerational collective guilt as a legitimation for aggression.\nMany other frames exist in the perceptions of this war; in our opinion, these "},"document":{"title":"This Time We Knew","author":"Thomas Cushman","publisher":"New York University Press","id":99,"isbn":"9780814715352"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":41359,"display_name":"American Association for Advancement of Slavic Studies"},"id":102333,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":41387,"display_name":"Balkan War -- root cause of"},"id":102385,"ring_next":28089,"ring_prev":28077},{"basket":{"id":41407,"display_name":"Blitz, Brad K"},"id":102445,"ring_next":28337,"ring_prev":28078},{"basket":{"id":41427,"display_name":"Bosnian Serbs -- portrayal as victims of Croat-Muslim aggression"},"id":102510,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":41458,"display_name":"Collective guilt -- doctrine of"},"id":102599,"ring_next":28087,"ring_prev":28087},{"basket":{"id":41475,"display_name":"Croatia -- fascist Ustasha regime in World War II"},"id":102645,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":41518,"display_name":"Ethnic cleansing"},"id":102722,"ring_next":28089,"ring_prev":28074},{"basket":{"id":41548,"display_name":"Frames of reference -- sociological term for rationalization"},"id":102795,"ring_next":28090,"ring_prev":28080},{"basket":{"id":46122,"display_name":"genocide"},"id":102814,"ring_next":28089,"ring_prev":28082},{"basket":{"id":1263,"display_name":"Israel"},"id":102974,"ring_next":28089,"ring_prev":22619},{"basket":{"id":18578,"display_name":"Jews"},"id":102988,"ring_next":28100,"ring_prev":28070},{"basket":{"id":41621,"display_name":"Kofman, Daniel"},"id":103022,"ring_next":28089,"ring_prev":28069},{"basket":{"id":41631,"display_name":"Krajina -- Serbian revolt"},"id":103040,"ring_next":28101,"ring_prev":28101},{"basket":{"id":36568,"display_name":"Muslims"},"id":103154,"ring_next":28087,"ring_prev":24301},{"basket":{"id":826,"display_name":"The New York Times"},"id":103222,"ring_next":28092,"ring_prev":28080},{"basket":{"id":41763,"display_name":"Serbia -- military juggernaut of"},"id":103400,"ring_next":28089,"ring_prev":28083},{"basket":{"id":41783,"display_name":"Serbian propaganda"},"id":103434,"ring_next":28101,"ring_prev":28104}],"localid":"page_25","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch01.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_25\">","css_selector":"#page_25","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_25\"]"},"next_location_id":28086,"previous_location_id":28084}]
