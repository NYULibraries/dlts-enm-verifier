Ferguson is the Jamaican immigrant living in New York who killed six people and wounded nineteen others on a Long Island commuter train in 1993. Initially his lawyers said they were going to use a black rage defense as part of an insanity claim. Ferguson later fired them and represented himself, denying that he had done the shootings. In the massive publicity surrounding the case many pundits portrayed the black rage defense as an attempt to justify violence against white people solely on the basis of previous racial oppression. Commentators also criticized the defense as an abdication of individual responsibility. These criticisms are enshrined in Alan Dershowitz’s book The Abuse Excuse, which attacks all environmentally based defenses.\nIn fact, no black rage defense has ever argued that African Americans are entitled to attack whites solely because of a history of oppression. However, the improper use of the defense by well-meaning lawyers can leave an impression that racial violence against individual whites is a legitimate response to racial discrimination. A mistaken strategy can also lead to a “poor-me” characterization of the defendant. A review of actual cases reveals that judges and juries will reject a defense based on race hatred or victimization.\nThese inaccurate stereotypes of black rage cases can be symbolized by the picture of an angry black male with a gun in his hand standing over a dead white man. In fact, the cases include all types of crimes, and the black rage defense is often used in positive situations such as self-defense. Nor is it limited to men—African American women also feel agony, grief, misery and anger. The richness of African American literature reminds us of their rage. Just a few years after the success of Native Son, Ann Petry’s novel The Street was published. Petry’s heroine, Lutie Johnson, uses a candlestick to crush the skull of a black man who has abused her. Her violence is described as a reaction to a “lifetime of pent-up resentment.”\n\nFirst she was venting her rage against the dirty, crowded street. She saw the rows of dilapidated old houses; the small dark rooms; the long steep flights of stairs; the narrow dingy hallways; the little lost girls in Mrs. Hedges’ apartment; the smashed homes where the women did drudgery because their men had deserted them.\nThen the limp figure on the sofa became ... the insult in the moist-eyed glances of white men on the subway; became the unconcealed hostility in "},"document":{"title":"Black Rage Confronts the Law","author":"Paul Harris","publisher":"New York University","id":95,"isbn":"9780814735923"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":39836,"display_name":"Black rage -- in literature"},"id":98598,"ring_next":26792,"ring_prev":26792},{"basket":{"id":39847,"display_name":"Black rage defense -- improper use"},"id":98624,"ring_next":26946,"ring_prev":26946},{"basket":{"id":39849,"display_name":"Black rage defense -- mischaracterization as race-hatred defense"},"id":98629,"ring_next":27064,"ring_prev":26794},{"basket":{"id":39854,"display_name":"Black rage defense -- women"},"id":98638,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":39910,"display_name":"Dershowitz, Alan, The Abuse Excuse"},"id":98714,"ring_next":27003,"ring_prev":27016},{"basket":{"id":39922,"display_name":"Ferguson, Colin"},"id":98731,"ring_next":26943,"ring_prev":26943},{"basket":{"id":40043,"display_name":"Petry, Ann, The Street"},"id":98920,"ring_next":26796,"ring_prev":26796},{"basket":{"id":40131,"display_name":"Women -- applicability of black rage defense"},"id":99036,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_6","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/intro.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_6\">","css_selector":"#page_6","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_6\"]"},"next_location_id":26796,"previous_location_id":26794}]
