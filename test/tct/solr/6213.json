As in Edwin Porter's famous 1902 film Life of an American Fireman, this film utilizes back-to-back scenes that show the same period of time from two different points of view. The innovation of crosscutting did not yet signify simultaneity of action, hence the gap in continuity. I discuss a similar chronological strategy later in the chapter with regard to Women's Rights.\n42. A description of the film in Bioscope (13 January 1910, 57) indicates that the butler's name is James, while the maid is never given a name. The reviewer calls the film, “One of the finest plays we have witnessed for a long time.”\n43. A more positive version of the same scenario occurred in the 1911 Hepworth film Rachel's Sin. Here, a man takes the blame for murder when the woman he loves accidentally kills her vicious, drunken husband. In this case, however, she remains faithful to him while he is in jail. As in A Woman's Treachery, the film privileges fidelity in love above fidelity to the law. For a description of this film, which no longer survives, see Bioscope, 9 November 1911, 445.\n44. An exception is the 1905 Hepworth film Den of Thieves, which features a housemaid who serves as informant and accomplice to a gang of robbers. She is eventually caught, and agrees to lead the police to the criminals.\n45. The film was later retitled The Anarchist's Doom; it is held in the BFI.\n46. See Bioscope, 10 July 1913, 145.\n47. Militant suffrage agitators were called “suffragettes,” while women using legal means to campaign for the vote were “suffragists.” The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) was the home of the militant suffragettes, while the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) was the mainstream organization. See Nelson for a collection of contemporary pro- and antisuffrage writings. See Hamer, Tickner, and Stanley for more on the British suffrage campaign. See Haslam for discussion of a prison narrative by Lady Constance Lytton, a member of the WSPU, and for more on suffragettes' experience in the penal system.\n48. Gifford titles this film The Lady Barber.\n49. An advertisement for the film depicts picketing women whose posters proclaim, “We will not tell our age” as well as “Votes for Women” (Film House Record, 4 March 1911, 387). The film is held at the BFI.\n50. See “Insanity or Crime?” for contemporary film periodicals' response.\n51. Stott notes that antisuffrage posters were also informed by degeneration theory (Fabrication 202).\n52. Chaplin's film is also known as The Busy Day. I viewed it at the BFI and the Library of Congress, but it is available in many film archives.\n53. The film is also called Ladies' Skirts Nailed to Fence, but its correct title (Women's Rights) clarifies how audiences understood the subject of the film. In its current state, the film does not make the women's politics explicit, but catalog accounts refer to the women as “suffragettes” and assert that they are discussing enfranchisement. Surviving copies of early films don't relay all of the information that audiences would have received: “exhibition aids” such as lecturers, narrators, printed programs, sound effects, or “even actors speaking dialogue behind the screen” were common (Sopocy 123). Intertitles were rare before 1905, but catalog accounts of Women's Rights indicate that audiences learned through some means that the women are suffragettes.\n"},"document":{"title":"Framed: The New Woman Criminal in British Culture at the Fin de Siecle","author":"Elizabeth Carolyn Miller","publisher":"University of Michigan Press and University of Michigan Library","id":29,"isbn":"9780472024469"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":7465,"display_name":"advertising / advertisements"},"id":24030,"ring_next":6214,"ring_prev":6209},{"basket":{"id":7469,"display_name":"alcoholism"},"id":24047,"ring_next":10597,"ring_prev":6209},{"basket":{"id":7502,"display_name":"Bioscope"},"id":24166,"ring_next":6019,"ring_prev":6211},{"basket":{"id":7543,"display_name":"Chaplin, Charlie"},"id":24261,"ring_next":30322,"ring_prev":6108},{"basket":{"id":7592,"display_name":"Den of Thieves (1905)"},"id":24586,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":7606,"display_name":"domestic abuse"},"id":24654,"ring_next":5978,"ring_prev":6207},{"basket":{"id":265,"display_name":"film(s)"},"id":25066,"ring_next":6214,"ring_prev":6212},{"basket":{"id":7691,"display_name":"film -- crime film"},"id":25102,"ring_next":6214,"ring_prev":6212},{"basket":{"id":7696,"display_name":"Film House Record"},"id":25113,"ring_next":6091,"ring_prev":6112},{"basket":{"id":7739,"display_name":"Hepworth Manufacturing Company"},"id":25233,"ring_next":6079,"ring_prev":6105},{"basket":{"id":7755,"display_name":"Interrupted Honeymoon, An (1905)"},"id":25366,"ring_next":6004,"ring_prev":6102},{"basket":{"id":7782,"display_name":"Life of an American Fireman (1902)"},"id":25539,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":7838,"display_name":"Militant Suffragette, The"},"id":25719,"ring_next":6108,"ring_prev":6108},{"basket":{"id":7851,"display_name":"murder"},"id":25774,"ring_next":14034,"ring_prev":6209},{"basket":{"id":7854,"display_name":"National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies"},"id":25778,"ring_next":5981,"ring_prev":5985},{"basket":{"id":7892,"display_name":"police and policing"},"id":25978,"ring_next":6216,"ring_prev":6206},{"basket":{"id":7897,"display_name":"Porter, Edwin"},"id":26009,"ring_next":6088,"ring_prev":6088},{"basket":{"id":7900,"display_name":"prisons"},"id":26028,"ring_next":6218,"ring_prev":6208},{"basket":{"id":7908,"display_name":"Rachel's Sin (1911)"},"id":26109,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":7933,"display_name":"Scroggins as a Census Official (1911)"},"id":26223,"ring_next":6107,"ring_prev":6107},{"basket":{"id":7674,"display_name":"suffrage movement"},"id":26471,"ring_next":6214,"ring_prev":6207},{"basket":{"id":7970,"display_name":"Suffragette in the Barber Shop (1898)"},"id":26479,"ring_next":6107,"ring_prev":6107},{"basket":{"id":7675,"display_name":"suffragettes"},"id":26489,"ring_next":6220,"ring_prev":6195},{"basket":{"id":6007,"display_name":"theft"},"id":26577,"ring_next":5990,"ring_prev":6192},{"basket":{"id":7987,"display_name":"Tube of Death, The (1913)"},"id":26615,"ring_next":6006,"ring_prev":6105},{"basket":{"id":7991,"display_name":"United States -- U.S. films / film industry"},"id":26640,"ring_next":6214,"ring_prev":6212},{"basket":{"id":8014,"display_name":"Woman's Treachery, A (1910)"},"id":26758,"ring_next":6006,"ring_prev":6105},{"basket":{"id":7677,"display_name":"women in the political sphere"},"id":26788,"ring_next":5996,"ring_prev":6207},{"basket":{"id":8015,"display_name":"Women's Rights (1898)"},"id":26820,"ring_next":6011,"ring_prev":6108},{"basket":{"id":8016,"display_name":"Women's Social and Political Union"},"id":26824,"ring_next":5981,"ring_prev":6195}],"localid":"page_239","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/17_notes.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_239\">","css_selector":"#page_239","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_239\"]"},"next_location_id":6214,"previous_location_id":6212}]
