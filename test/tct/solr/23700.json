In reading, the threatening world outside can seem held at a distance from vulnerable self-systems. The self does not face the world but only its representations of it. Chapter 4 discusses this protected space of reading in relation to Victor Nell’s description of the “state of absorption” common to readers. In this narcissistically protected space, our perceptions of the world can be more playful; libido is made more fluid to experiment with internal representations, thereby formulating new adjustments in both the self-system and the field system.\nReading is narcissistic in three senses. First it is narcissistic in so far as it offers a protected space for reading, space that is regressive, self-referential, and insular. Second, reading is narcissistic because it engages the narcissistic dialectics that contribute to the ongoing regulation of the self-system and thus greater mastery of psychic conflict. Literary engagement relaxes the ego, so it can entertain conflict and take pleasure in narcissistic dialectics that in other contexts would be too threatening. Last, reading is narcissistic to the extent that it experiments with imaginary libidinal investments and transformations.\nTheorists from Freud to Lacan have described narcissism differently, but there is one thread that runs through all these theoretical positions: an interest in the nature, quality, and fluidity of libidinal investments. Freud first began to develop a complicated notion of narcissism when he saw its potential to explain transformations in libido. More recently, Otto Kernberg has developed his own understanding of narcissism by emphasizing the relationship between narcissism and the “vicissitudes of libido.” According to Kernberg, “Narcissism cannot be divorced from the study of the vicissitudes of both libido and aggression and from the study of the vicissitudes of internalized object relations.”21 For Kernberg narcissism is a term covering those processes whereby the various internal components—libido, aggression, and internalized objects—of the self are modified. Kernberg’s account of narcissism broadens Freud’s account by seeing narcissism in developmental and not exclusively pathological terms.\nKernberg’s explanation of the relationship between narcissism and libido is especially interesting because it suggests that libidinal attachments are not driven fundamentally by instinct, but driven by a culturally and psychologically conditioned flow of desire determined initially "},"document":{"title":"Narcissism and the Literary Libido","author":"Marshall W.
