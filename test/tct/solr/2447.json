Because it has been thought that China is more of a collective society, it has been assumed that there is less concern for how intellectual property is appropriated or attributed. Therefore, a greater degree of imitation in the creation of new intellectual property is both encouraged and valued. These assumptions underlie the belief that all English-language learners bring to the classroom a different value system in regard to plagiarism than the one prevalent in the West (Howard “Standing”; Chandrasoma, Thompson, and Pennycook). Chandrasoma, Thompson, and Pennycook argue that some forms of plagiarism can be acts of resistance to the dominant forms of rhetoric, especially where these forms contradict the students' own epistemological traditions (189).\nThese problems can be especially true in Chinese cultures where imitation has long been highly valued. The link between originality and ownership, which often shapes the moral metaphors regarding “theft” related to discussions of plagiarism in the West, may not be as clear-cut in Chinese culture. This essay will examine the nature of this relationship between imitation and originality and how a different perspective on this relationship can affect both our attitudes toward plagiarism and how we teach our L2 students about plagiarism.\nI became interested in this topic because of two incidents I experienced many years ago when I was teaching in China. I was teaching at a time when there were still few materials available to my students about current trends in composition pedagogy. My aunt had forwarded a copy of College English that contained Carolyn Matalene's often cited and highly controversial article on contrastive rhetoric, which was based on her teaching experiences in China. I gave copies of this article to my students to read and respond to. That evening there was a knock on our door from a group of very agitated students, who were upset at what Matalene had said, particularly about how Chinese students do not seem to share a negative attitude toward plagiarism that she would expect to find. I would later tell this story to Alton Becker, who has written extensively on intercultural linguistics. His response was that when you tell someone they are different, they think you mean they are inferior, a topic that I will return to later.\nThe second incident I encountered illustrates how the basis of this controversy over plagiarism has its roots in the concepts of imitation and originality. During a visit to my father-in-law, who is a well-known professor of Western art in Guangzhou, I told him about an exhibit of a thousand years of Chinese art and how impressed I was with the continuity of the artworks across such a long period of time. He glared at me across the dining\n"},"document":{"title":"Originality, Imitation, and Plagiarism","author":"Eisner, Caroline; Vicinus, Martha","publisher":"University of Michigan Press and University of Michigan Library","id":12,"isbn":"9780472024445"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2533,"display_name":"Becker, Alton"},"id":8548,"ring_next":2449,"ring_prev":2455},{"basket":{"id":2580,"display_name":"China -- art"},"id":8640,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":2581,"display_name":"China -- culture"},"id":8642,"ring_next":2449,"ring_prev":2446},{"basket":{"id":2583,"display_name":"China -- students"},"id":8646,"ring_next":2448,"ring_prev":2451},{"basket":{"id":2783,"display_name":"imitation -- value of"},"id":9226,"ring_next":2231,"ring_prev":2231},{"basket":{"id":2792,"display_name":"intellectual property"},"id":9245,"ring_next":2449,"ring_prev":2404},{"basket":{"id":2861,"display_name":"Matalene, Carolyn"},"id":9412,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":2931,"display_name":"originality"},"id":9558,"ring_next":2449,"ring_prev":2436},{"basket":{"id":3110,"display_name":"Western art"},"id":10056,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_220","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/27_chap19.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_220\">","css_selector":"#page_220","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_220\"]"},"next_location_id":2448,"previous_location_id":2446}]
