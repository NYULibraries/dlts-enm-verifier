While doubted by some, the conclusions of the Anti-Defamation League’s 1992 Audit of Anti-Semitic Incidents are alarming, even with the caveat that the implications of such social science surveys are ambiguous. The ADL Audit found that approximately 50 million Americans hold “strong” antisemitic beliefs.47 Worse still, these Americans “qualified” as strongly antisemitic by answering affirmatively at least six out of eleven questions that tested for overt antisemitism, such as whether Jews are more willing than others to use shady practices to get ahead.48 Many more Americans answered one or more of these questions affirmatively without reaching the number needed to qualify as strongly antisemitic. For example, approximately 77.5 million Americans believe that Jews have too much power in the United States. Thus, in just over one decade, the proportion of Americans believing that Jews have too much power has increased from 10 percent to over 30 percent!49 Significantly, the ADL Audit does not even attempt to measure or report the number of Americans who harbor antisemitic attitudes but do not express them overtly, either because of social etiquette or because their antisemitism operates primarily at an unconscious or unintentional level. At a minimum, then, one should certainly be wary of claims that antisemitism in America is dying or dead.50\nSpecific reports of antisemitic incidents, including violence and vandalism, support the conclusion that overt antisemitism has been increasing over the last ten to fifteen years. From 1988 to 1992, the number of antisemitic episodes on college campuses, usually involving graffiti and hate speech, grew by 110 percent. Throughout the 1980s, the number of attacks on or defacements of Jewish homes, synagogues, and community centers increased relatively consistently. In a startling incident in 1992, a drama group at an Indiana high school was presenting a play about Jewish survivors of the Nazi concentration camps. When the non-Jewish cast wore the Jewish stars from their costumes, they were subjected to “flagrant antisemitism.” One cast member stated: “I was in class and people were snickering ‘I hate Jews’ and ‘Jews killed Christ’.”51\nOvert antisemitism even has begun to reemerge as a political force. Whereas less than twenty years ago an obviously antisemitic statement would have probably been fatal to a public life, in politics or otherwise, "},"document":{"title":"Please don’t Wish me a Merry Christmas","author":"Stephen M.
