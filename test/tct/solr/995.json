The consequences of this common history of global hegemonic power—in particular as it relates to transnational cultural influence—are, however, yet to be fully explored. The “power triad” of France, Japan, and the United States thus remains a productive focus. It allows us to consider how powerful global cultural producers negotiate the global/national/local nexus in relationship to each other—just as “the global” contains an imagined dimension, the nation/national is a contested site, “an evolving, imaginary construct rather than an originary essence” (Shohat and Stam, 2003, p. 11). Because it involves sites that have historically, and at times contentiously, been positioned as “Western” (France and the United States) and “Eastern” (Japan), it also offers opportunities to complicate, and possibly deconstruct, “East/West” and well as “West/West” dynamics.\nThere is no denying that the United States has historically been an influential force in the development of global popular cultural forms. This book will demonstrate that this historical legacy remains a significant, even if contested, element of individuals’ imagination of the global. Furthermore, while there is evidence that the global influence of the U.S. media is declining, exactly what this decline might mean for both U.S. and “global” media audiences is yet to be fully articulated. Studies of global media “flows” such as, for instance, Jeremy Tunstall’s (2008) The Media Were American (written as a revision to his 1979 classic Media Are American) usefully point to a number of new actors entering the scene of transnational popular cultural influence (Bollywood movies, telenovelas, animation). A number of scholars have critically analyzed various aspects of these texts. Fewer works, however, have empirically and comparatively examined how these relative newcomers’ entry onto the global popular cultural scene might intersect with transnational audiences’ negotiation of the global—or how they might, concretely, shift the balance of power of transnational cultural influence beyond the most obvious economic level.\nGlobal media scholar and feminist critic Radhika Parameswaran suggests that “the ‘American dream’ and the ‘American ways of life’” remain “persuasive ideological constructs that circulate in varied transnational contexts to produce shifting global allegiances that in turn revive the idea of America\n"},"document":{"title":"Imagining the Global: Transnational Media and Popular Culture Beyond East and West","author":"Darling-Wolf, Fabienne","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":6,"isbn":"9780472120796"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1066,"display_name":"Bollywood movies"},"id":3088,"ring_next":1073,"ring_prev":1142},{"basket":{"id":235,"display_name":"China"},"id":3168,"ring_next":997,"ring_prev":624},{"basket":{"id":1139,"display_name":"Dyson, Michael Eric -- East, the"},"id":3300,"ring_next":999,"ring_prev":1002},{"basket":{"id":2204,"display_name":"West vs. non-West dichotomy."},"id":3303,"ring_next":998,"ring_prev":2142},{"basket":{"id":1204,"display_name":"global, the, defined -- global/national/local nexus"},"id":3462,"ring_next":996,"ring_prev":994},{"basket":{"id":1207,"display_name":"globalization -- cultural"},"id":3494,"ring_next":1001,"ring_prev":993},{"basket":{"id":1209,"display_name":"globalization -- economic"},"id":3509,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1252,"display_name":"ideology"},"id":3674,"ring_next":1000,"ring_prev":30444},{"basket":{"id":1255,"display_name":"imaginary, the -- global"},"id":3683,"ring_next":1002,"ring_prev":992},{"basket":{"id":1274,"display_name":"Japan -- Japan / France / U.S. triad"},"id":3779,"ring_next":998,"ring_prev":994},{"basket":{"id":1032,"display_name":"Japanese anime and manga"},"id":3837,"ring_next":1009,"ring_prev":994},{"basket":{"id":1285,"display_name":"Japanese anime and manga -- in U.S."},"id":3860,"ring_next":1002,"ring_prev":994},{"basket":{"id":1206,"display_name":"Globalization -- Media globalization"},"id":4001,"ring_next":996,"ring_prev":2199},{"basket":{"id":1410,"display_name":"Parameswaran, Radhika"},"id":4194,"ring_next":1002,"ring_prev":1059},{"basket":{"id":1517,"display_name":"telenovelas"},"id":4458,"ring_next":1128,"ring_prev":1142},{"basket":{"id":1535,"display_name":"Tunstall, Jeremy"},"id":4524,"ring_next":1890,"ring_prev":2047},{"basket":{"id":1548,"display_name":"United States -- global imagination of"},"id":4553,"ring_next":996,"ring_prev":1143},{"basket":{"id":1549,"display_name":"United States -- global influence of popular culture"},"id":4563,"ring_next":998,"ring_prev":1140},{"basket":{"id":1550,"display_name":"United States -- media"},"id":4577,"ring_next":996,"ring_prev":1125},{"basket":{"id":1553,"display_name":"United States -- as \"the West\""},"id":4590,"ring_next":998,"ring_prev":1148},{"basket":{"id":1562,"display_name":"West, the (Westernism, Westernness)"},"id":4613,"ring_next":997,"ring_prev":1138}],"localid":"page_4","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/introduction.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_4\">","css_selector":"#page_4","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_4\"]"},"next_location_id":996,"previous_location_id":994}]
