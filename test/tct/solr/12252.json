Nor should we forget that folly for Christ’s sake existed in other branches of Christianity, such as Greek Orthodoxy. It is curious, however, that thirty-six Russian fools have been canonized, while only six Greeks have. Saward is quite justified to speak of the “Russian enthusiasm” for holy foolishness.32\nIn the middle of the seventeenth century a new catalyst for masochistic practices developed on the Russian religious scene. It was at this time that a schism (“Raskol”) arose between the official Russian Orthodox Church and a loosely affiliated group which eventually came to be called the Old Believers or Old Ritualists (“staroobriadtsy”).33 At issue were general questions of the growing secularization of Russian culture, the hierarchicalization of church authority, and the acceptability of foreign models for religious behavior. There were also some very specific issues of ritual, especially the question of how to make a proper Sign of the Cross. The Orthodox Patriarch Nikon, influenced by contemporary Greek Orthodoxy, issued instructions proscribing the old practice of using two fingers to cross oneself and requiring that this gesture be performed with three fingers instead. The theological doctrine behind this change is somewhat obscure (apparently three fingers signify the Holy Trinity, two signify the dual, divine-human essence of Christ). But the reaction to the new rule on the part of religious conservatives, such as the notorious Archpriest Avvakum (1620-82), was clear and categorical: “That wolf Nikon, in league with the devil, betrayed us through this crossing with three fingers.” In particular the change in ritual was viewed by Old Believers as an opportunity to become victims:\nIn the instruction Nikon wrote: “Year and date. According to the tradition of the Holy Apostles and the Holy Fathers it is not your bounden duty to bow down to the knee, but you are to bow to the waist; in addition, you are to cross yourself with three fingers.” Having come together we fell to thinking; we saw that winter was on the way—hearts froze and legs began to shake. Neronov turned the cathedral over to me and went himself into seclusion at the Chudov-sky monastery; for a week he prayed in a cell. And there a voice from the icon spoke to him during a prayer: “The time of suffering hath begun; it is thy bounden duty to suffer without weakening!”34\n"},"document":{"title":"The Slave Soul of Russia","author":"Daniel Rancour-Laferriere","publisher":"New York University Press","id":49,"isbn":"9780814774823"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":18988,"display_name":"Avvakum"},"id":51597,"ring_next":12253,"ring_prev":12496},{"basket":{"id":19018,"display_name":"Billington, James"},"id":51717,"ring_next":12255,"ring_prev":12250},{"basket":{"id":17925,"display_name":"Christ"},"id":52662,"ring_next":12253,"ring_prev":12249},{"basket":{"id":19431,"display_name":"Nikon"},"id":53239,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":19444,"display_name":"Old Believers"},"id":53273,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":19535,"display_name":"Russian Orthodoxy"},"id":53568,"ring_next":12259,"ring_prev":12230},{"basket":{"id":19552,"display_name":"Saward, John"},"id":53676,"ring_next":12482,"ring_prev":12482},{"basket":{"id":19585,"display_name":"Sign of the Cross"},"id":53806,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_23","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch02.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_23\">","css_selector":"#page_23","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_23\"]"},"next_location_id":12253,"previous_location_id":12251}]
