A similar shot in SH1 follows Harry in the alley where Cheryl has entered. However, the directors of the first three games of the series (SH1's Keiichiro Toyama, SH2's Masahi Tsuboyama, and SH3's Kazuhide Nakazawa) have done a really great job making the montage of their action more expressive and dynamic. They do not divert the attention away from information. On the contrary, the camera cuts to a new shot in order to point out the entrance of the next location or to draw attention to the presence of items. The player characters are always turning their heads to look at those important elements. If Gordon's house is not marked on the map, there is a notable cut to the alley that indicates to Harry the back access to this teacher's house. Of course, as in any survival horror game, Tsuboyama and his fellows play with the field of action in order to hide monsters off-screen once in a while. The Nurse's sudden appearance when James enters Room M3 of the Brookhaven Hospital is a good example of these scary moments. Indoors, where montage is most often displayed, the directors keep the over-the-shoulder/head view when you get back in a corridor to set off the player character's movement. But their preset camera positions and angles upon the entrance to a room vary superbly. They reposition the camera from the back to the front of the room, from a low to a high angle, from lighting the enemies frontally or leaving them in back light, and so on. With the power of SH3's graphics engine, Nakazawa is able to compose exceptional frames leaving us in awe, as in the low-angle shot through the wheel of a wheelchair, spinning when Heather moves forward in the basement of the Brookhaven Hospital, or the breathtaking image in the room of the church that Heather explores to find the cassette tape (fig. 9).\nOne is still astonished at how beautiful this may be upon viewing James in SH2 through the big ceiling fan in the room where he gets the Great Knife of Pyramid Head, or seeing a Flying Reptile moving around Harry in SH2 and passing just in front the airborne camera in the rear foreground. The vertical angle in the women's restroom of SH: 0rigins' Cedar Groove Sanitarium with the blood inscription “Bring me my son” is quite impressive as well.\nThe movements of the virtual camera are what sets SH1 apart from the first Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil games. Along with the vertical angle, the camera follows Harry in the alley at the beginning of the game. Actually, from the moment Harry crosses the fence and arrives in the alley, only two high-angle shots are fixed. Otherwise, the camera does not stop moving.
