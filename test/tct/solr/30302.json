Detailed explanations of film terms and techniques—ranging from simpler definitions of the long shot or the fadeout (replete with English renderings) to much more expansive clarifications of generic categories and cinematic styles—appeared regularly in the earlier issues. Each issue in the entire first volume of Yŏnghwa Segye seems in fact to have prominently featured in their opening pages a kind of glossary of basic film terminology, starting in the first issue with brief definitions of the role of each member of a credited film company (the producer, the director, the cinematographer, etc.) and progressing, by the sixth issue, to the more complex workings of a typical Hollywood studio. On another level, Yŏnghwa Segye is peppered with shorter articles, letters, and single-panel comics that take on the task of creating proper filmgoing manners and ideas. In one letter in the inaugural issue, for instance, a writer complains about the “old-fashioned” (kusik) habit of certain members of the audience of talking at the screen—something that is identified with the “outdated” pyŏnsa-mediated cinema culture.26\nOld-timers clearly had to adjust to the new theaters and learn the new conventions of filmgoing. And yet general, presumably younger, audiences too, at least in the eyes of the magazine’s editors, needed to be told how a movie was made, what to look for, and how to appreciate what they were watching. All of this pressure on the way to watch films, and to substantiate their cultural position, is especially striking when we consider that films had already been screened in Korea for over thirty years and that Seoul at least had seen an exuberant screen culture as early as the late 1920s. The most immediately obvious way to account for this seemingly excessive exhortation is to consider that virtually a generation—that is, between the nearly complete closure of the commercial film industry in the late 1930s to the reconstruction of the (both local and import) industry in the latter stages of the war in 1953—had been deprived of a bona fide filmgoing culture.27 But while this is certainly a crucial factor, it is not the whole story. In order to get a better picture of what was going on here in the magazines and in film culture as a whole, we need to look more carefully at the images themselves.\nA scan through the pages of these magazines quickly reveals a powerful tendency of filmmaking in the 1950s and the fashion and fan cultures that underwrote it. The eye, reflecting the magnifications of the big screen as well, perhaps, as the increasingly close traffic of the rapidly expanding cities, was being drawn much more consistently and analytically toward the "},"document":{"title":"Split Screen Korea","author":"Steven Chung","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","id":110,"isbn":"9781452941516"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":44883,"display_name":"culture(s) -- film"},"id":112131,"ring_next":30317,"ring_prev":30284},{"basket":{"id":44912,"display_name":"enlightenment modality -- in filmmaking"},"id":112237,"ring_next":30441,"ring_prev":30292},{"basket":{"id":44947,"display_name":"film(s) -- culture of"},"id":112359,"ring_next":30317,"ring_prev":30284},{"basket":{"id":44968,"display_name":"filmmaking -- enlightenment in"},"id":112445,"ring_next":30441,"ring_prev":30292},{"basket":{"id":45359,"display_name":"Yŏnghwa Segye (magazine)"},"id":113941,"ring_next":30303,"ring_prev":30301}],"localid":"page_64","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/xhtml/chapter2.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"pg_64\"/>","css_selector":"#pg_64","xpath":"a[@id=\"pg_64\"]"},"next_location_id":30303,"previous_location_id":30301}]
