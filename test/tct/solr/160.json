I am not finding my keys in the usual places. Should I retrace my steps next? Is it worth considering that I may have locked them inside the car? The basic “problem with heuristics”—in some cases a crippling problem, which could lead to the inadvertent elimination of the entire branch of a desired outcome branch from the search tree—“is how to decide half-way what would be an appropriate next action, i.e. how to design heuristic rules that lead to good solutions instead of bad ones” (Krista Lagus). Tellingly, we often attribute decisions in successful heuristic processes to intuition and those that result in undesirable outcomes to confusion and bad luck.\nIf the heuristic process fails or seems too unsystematic for comfort, a desperate searcher can always resort to a true algorithm:\n \nFor each room in the house; and\nFor each item in the room;\nPick up and examine the item.\nIf the item appears by objective criteria to be the missing object, terminate the search.\nIf not, put down the item and continue this loop until all items have been tested.\n \nEventually, if this little program is executed perfectly, I will either find my keys or determine conclusively that they are not in the house. There’s a kind of predestination or special providence about an algorithm, formally defined. That is to say, I know to expect one of two prescribed outcomes before even undertaking the search process. And—as its strict definition requires—the algorithm is almost wholly generalizable. If I suspect I have left my keys at your house, I can run the process there. If the misplaced object is a watch, or a hat, the algorithm is equally applicable. (Of course, it is not a very efficient algorithm because it requires me, for example, to pick up and examine the house-cat—and to do so every time it saunters into a new room—but we can easily imagine more elegant versions of this basic method.)\nSome common refinements to the concept of the algorithm are particularly relevant to interpretive or hermeneutic activity, which, by virtue of its realm of application, is generally predicated on ambiguity and flux. Algorithms are expected to be both perfectly precise and entirely implementable. An old bubblegum wrapper joke helps to make this point: how do you fit four elephants into a Volkswagen? The algorithmic answer is that you simply put two in the front seat and two in the back. Although those steps are clearly unambiguous, they are impossible to implement. In contrast is a commonplace algorithm for finishing one’s dissertation:\n \n"},"document":{"title":"Pastplay: Teaching and Learning History with Technology","author":"Kee, Kevin","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":1,"isbn":"9780472120482"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_152","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter07.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_152\">","css_selector":"#page_152","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_152\"]"},"next_location_id":161,"previous_location_id":159}]
