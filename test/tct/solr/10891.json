He attempts to approach her, is dragged back to the table by Count Brahe, and finally in his terror rushes out of the dining hall. But the last time they see the ghost, the master of the hunt manages to stay in the room and, as the count raises a glass of wine toward him, is just able to raise his own glass, as if it were a great weight, a few inches off the table (37). Malte makes the meaning of his father’s behavior clear. He asks himself a question concerning the master of the hunt which seems to answer itself. “Had he wanted to force himself, precisely because he was of such a passionate nature and yet so invested in logic and clarity, to endure this adventure calmly and unquestioningly?” The father’s behavior and his character are intelligible to his son only in retrospect. “I saw, without comprehending, how he struggled with himself, and how, in the end, he triumphed” (36).\nMalte’s attempt to formulate the father’s character in this passage comes early in the novel. Nowhere else does he credit the master of the hunt with “a passionate nature.” Does the passage involve a brief attempt to redeem Herr Brigge, to give him admirable qualities? Does it cast light on Rilke’s understanding of Josef? Sieber says that the poet got his extraordinary strength of will from his mother. Does Malte’s expressed sense of his father’s triumphant struggle with himself in this episode suggest that Rainer may have thought of Josef as a model for the struggle of the will to overcome inner weakness, fear, and disappointment at frustration and failure? Having given up his hopes of an officer’s career, Josef worked his way up to “a fairly high post in a private railroad, which he has earned with infinite conscientiousness” (Letters 1:98). There is no evidence that he expressed despair or depression at his fate.\nAgainst this argument one must set the mute fear Rilke ascribes to his father in the letter to Benvenuta, the anxiety mentioned in the Fourth Elegy. In his account of the ghost’s visit at Urnekloster, Malte’s description of his father’s struggle for self-mastery undermines, with implicit satiric irony, any appeal which this struggle might have for us. Reading the details of the father’s reactions to the first visitation, one feels that he is not admirable but ludicrous, leaping up from the table, “deathly pale,” with his hands “clenched at his sides,” shouting in fear and anger, his face “swollen with blood,” tearing himself away and rushing out of the room, neglecting, in his fright, to take his son with him (33–34). Later, as the ghost once more walks slowly past, responding to his father-in-law’s "},"document":{"title":"The Beginning of Terror","author":"David Kleinbard","publisher":"New York University Press","id":44,"isbn":"9780814746677"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":5765,"display_name":"Art -- irony"},"id":45518,"ring_next":3799,"ring_prev":10888},{"basket":{"id":16399,"display_name":"Hattingberg, Magda von (\"Benvenuta\")"},"id":45830,"ring_next":10923,"ring_prev":10873},{"basket":{"id":16500,"display_name":"Mastery -- self-mastery"},"id":46076,"ring_next":10893,"ring_prev":10893},{"basket":{"id":16659,"display_name":"Rilke's writings -- Duino Elegies (Duineser Elegien)"},"id":46477,"ring_next":10895,"ring_prev":10885},{"basket":{"id":16271,"display_name":"Satiric irony in Rilke's writings"},"id":46775,"ring_next":10901,"ring_prev":10888}],"localid":"page_149","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch07.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_149\">","css_selector":"#page_149","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_149\"]"},"next_location_id":10892,"previous_location_id":10890}]
