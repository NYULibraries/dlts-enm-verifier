Two general conceptual frameworks guided the present study: the sociology of knowledge and the powers of theory. The former concerns ontological and epistemological issues in international communication research; the latter addresses theoretical, ideological, and practical matters of theory in this field. If the findings in this study are any indication, the field of international communication research has exhibited a groupthink mentality in its conceptual approach. Scholars and researchers have yet to think outside the box of international communication inquiry, or, more specifically, the body of literature that has been established in this field.\nGroupthink often leads to stagnation or failure. At the abstract level, the mind-set of groupthink excludes alternative perspectives that should be relevant to international communication scholars and researchers who are engaged in the production of knowledge, especially when the received knowledge is delimited within certain geographical territories and defined by a specific perspective. Any empirical research is always bound by the particular context of space and time, within which ideas and ways of seeing and doing things are formulated. But knowledge does not necessarily recognize any national borders although there are historical conditions under which knowledge is generally being produced. The form of international communication is complex. Its determinants vary from country to country. Many competing explanations therefore can be applied to the same facts, depending on how they are theoretically conceived and methodologically analyzed.\nFor any theory to be valid in its knowledge claim about the reality of the social world, it has to be tested comparatively. Examining how a theory in international communication may fit the historical facts is neither adequate nor convincing. The world is as diverse as the number of countries in it. Perspectives of the reality are bound to be different when it is viewed from different locales. The relationship between theory and the facts is therefore changeable. As Galtung (1990) argued, “a good theory should\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2166,"display_name":"Comparative research (studies)"},"id":6658,"ring_next":1948,"ring_prev":1928},{"basket":{"id":2227,"display_name":"Galtung, Johan"},"id":7008,"ring_next":1929,"ring_prev":1935},{"basket":{"id":2322,"display_name":"media studies"},"id":7618,"ring_next":1989,"ring_prev":1923},{"basket":{"id":2384,"display_name":"Knowledge -- production of"},"id":7988,"ring_next":2067,"ring_prev":1944},{"basket":{"id":2412,"display_name":"Sociology of knowledge"},"id":8150,"ring_next":1894,"ring_prev":1930}],"localid":"page_60","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter03.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_60\">","css_selector":"#page_60","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_60\"]"},"next_location_id":1948,"previous_location_id":1946}]
