Every time you take a risk with your voice, pen, brush, and body, you reinvent and strengthen yourselves and encourage those of us who are fortunate enough to be in your presence to do the same.\nTo the PCAP associates, what can I say? While I cannot tell each of your stories and cannot list your 165 names, you have the final chapter of this book to yourselves, a chapter that is about all of you. At a July 2009 PCAP meeting, Evelyn Smith asked us to write down the talent we bring to PCAP. Matt Erickson wrote, “Showing up.” That sticks with me. Matt shows up for everyone's readings and performances, no matter how long the drive. He drove to Ionia and Coldwater for his workshops. He drives formerly incarcerated citizens to meetings and events. He always steps up and always brings his ideas and voice to meetings whether he thinks they will be popular or not. He is always present. He represents the ways you all showed up, often for each other and for PCAP, but most of all for the urban youth and incarcerated youth and adults with whom you worked. Thank you.\nKaren Goodyke, Laurie Hess, Pilar Horner, our early part-time administrators, and our later full- and almost full-time administrators and coordinators, Jesse Jannetta, Suzanne Gothard, Rachael Hudak, phoenix Moore, Emily Harris, Jaime Nelson, Sari Adelson, Ariella Kaufman, Jean Borger, and Mary Heinen, thank you for your ability to respond to stress, for your troubleshooting, for your willingness to sit at the table with each other and me and the members of PCAP and to work things out, for your willingness \n"},"document":{"title":"Is William Martinez Not Our Brother?: Twenty Years of the Prison Creative Arts Project","author":"Alexander, Buzz","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press and The University of Michigan Library","id":13,"isbn":"9780472027446"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":3145,"display_name":"Adelson, Sari"},"id":10191,"ring_next":2570,"ring_prev":2667},{"basket":{"id":3249,"display_name":"Borger, Jean"},"id":10424,"ring_next":2672,"ring_prev":2672},{"basket":{"id":3350,"display_name":"Coldwater, MI"},"id":10608,"ring_next":2527,"ring_prev":2707},{"basket":{"id":3454,"display_name":"Erickson, Matt -- \"Showing up\""},"id":10782,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":3525,"display_name":"Goodyke, Karen"},"id":10921,"ring_next":2542,"ring_prev":2688},{"basket":{"id":3527,"display_name":"Gothard, Suzanne"},"id":10926,"ring_next":2514,"ring_prev":2758},{"basket":{"id":3565,"display_name":"Harris, Emily"},"id":10991,"ring_next":2503,"ring_prev":2774},{"basket":{"id":3578,"display_name":"Heinen, Mary"},"id":11014,"ring_next":2681,"ring_prev":2773},{"basket":{"id":3587,"display_name":"Hess, Laurie"},"id":11048,"ring_next":2542,"ring_prev":2720},{"basket":{"id":3177,"display_name":"Horner, Pilar"},"id":11076,"ring_next":2660,"ring_prev":2733},{"basket":{"id":3610,"display_name":"Hudak, Rachael"},"id":11095,"ring_next":2514,"ring_prev":2514},{"basket":{"id":3629,"display_name":"Ionia, MI"},"id":11134,"ring_next":2542,"ring_prev":2635},{"basket":{"id":3641,"display_name":"Jannetta, Jesse"},"id":11163,"ring_next":2514,"ring_prev":2725},{"basket":{"id":3661,"display_name":"Kaufman, Ariella"},"id":11216,"ring_next":2664,"ring_prev":2664},{"basket":{"id":3814,"display_name":"Moore, phoenix"},"id":11513,"ring_next":2689,"ring_prev":2773},{"basket":{"id":3839,"display_name":"Nelson, Jaime"},"id":11568,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":3970,"display_name":"Prison Creative Arts Project (PCAP) -- associates"},"id":11785,"ring_next":2533,"ring_prev":2709},{"basket":{"id":4145,"display_name":"Smith, Evelyn"},"id":12213,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":4273,"display_name":"urban youth"},"id":12517,"ring_next":2512,"ring_prev":2758}],"localid":"page_vii","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/ack.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_vii\">","css_selector":"#page_vii","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_vii\"]"},"next_location_id":2502,"previous_location_id":2500}]
