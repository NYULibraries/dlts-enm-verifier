What if the landlords cared more for restricting abortion than for maintaining high profits in the rental business? Rent-seeking and restricting abortion make strange bedfellows. The deals can be made even when the expected payoff is uncertain, or even risky, if the interest group finds the risk to be worthwhile.\nThe deal-making theory of politics does not tell us how to find out what deals have actually been made. It does not tell us how to draw the boundaries of context, nor when to stop the clock and freeze the action. It commits itself, probably in spite of itself, to contextualized pragmatic decisions. Each case requires a look at the political universe.\nSuppose, though, that we reject the liberal theory of interest-group pluralism. One prevalent alternative is a version of civic republicanism.45 Under the tenets of civil republicanism, as reinterpreted by left-liberal thinkers, a political contextuality concern still poses a deep problem for taking decisions.46 Republicanism rests on a commitment to the flourishing of citizens in a community by means of their self-government. Most modern republicans understand that some groups have more power than others to define and constitute the political community. In keeping with this understanding, taking decisions should be viewed through a lens of political empowerment. Groups that have power to control the legislature, or other government action, and hence actually participate, even if informally, in the lawmaking that affects their holdings, should, when they experience losses in their holdings, be more readily understood as sacrificing some of their private interests for the public interest than should less powerful groups that are largely excluded from actual participation in lawmaking. If landlords have a dominant voice on the city council, whether formally or informally, then we may judge giving over some of their units to the use of the homeless as an appropriate contribution to their community’s political well-being. On the other hand, we might, as republicans, properly be more skeptical about the appropriateness of the sacrifice if low-income tenants were being asked to relinquish their units, or any important entitlements associated with tenancy.47 This concern means that the contextual circumstances of political power, of inclusion and exclusion from the "},"document":{"title":"Compensatory Justice","author":"John W.
