In cases of wrongful violations of rights, compensatory justice has a more modest, albeit important, task: to rectify the maldistribution of resources that results from wrongdoing. Although this may be a surprising conclusion, it nevertheless is attractive, for it shows why our rights so stubbornly resist being bought out, regardless of the size of the payment. Purely instrumental accounts of rights permit a complete return to equality after wrongful violation. And for that reason they are objectionable.\nA “return to equality” is possible only when rights have been justifiably infringed. Although aggressors can repay victims for the harm done, transfer of resources cannot right a wrong.\nNOTES\n1. Aristotle, The Ethics, trans. J. A. K.
