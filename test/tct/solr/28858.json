While this was the most explicit instance of a teacher advocating bilingualism I observed, it is important to note both that this was in the context of a predominantly White class and that the particular student she was addressing was a fluent English speaker who did not possess an accent and whose native language was not one that he used in school or that would be prominent in the community and thus perceived as some sort of threat to English. I never, for example, heard this sort of valuing of another language among classes with native Spanish speakers. However, a couple monolingual English-speaking teachers at Birch did make an effort to learn bits of Spanish from their students. Mr. James and Mr. Mecha, for example, both used an occasional Spanish word in casual conversation with their students. And yet at the same time, there were a number of teachers who clearly sent very discouraging messages about the use of languages other than English. One teacher, for example, told her students at various points during the year, “English only!” “If I wanted Spanish spoken I would have put you in a language class,” “Your language is English in this classroom; remember that,” and “We’re not in Somalia; it’s important that you understand that.”\n      Thus, at both Spruce and Birch, the overall message seemed to be that it was appropriate to use a language other than English as long as you were fluent in English and predominantly an English speaker, but that only English should be used in all other circumstances. These multiple messages about language make sense given teachers’ discourses about sameness and difference. English-only practices derive from an ideology of sameness and conservatism, whereas the encouragement of multiple languages in schools derives from an ideology of difference. Both sets of ideologies and practices, however, are couched within a framework of whiteness, where the status quo and the interests of the dominant group are protected.\n      The ambiguity between powerblind sameness and colorblind difference was also pervasive in professional development offered through the Zion School District. While attending a district workshop for teachers about using the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) model, I had a number of moments of confusion regarding who they were talking about, when the model should be used, and where they hoped it would be most effective. The workshop opened with the facilitator explaining that the model was developed for ELL students but that she would refer more generally to “diverse students.” She seemed to link this shift in language with the fact that a number of special education teachers were interested in this model. So because the SIOP model was not just about ELL students, she would usually talk about “diverse learners.” Nobody "},"document":{"title":"Educated in Whiteness","author":"Angelina E.
