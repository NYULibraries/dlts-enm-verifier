He also admits that it is difficult to live with someone who is chronically ill. He, too, is affected by the more isolated life we are now leading.…\nOur daughter is very supportive. She seems to accept my illness, and indeed cannot remember a time when I was healthy. She shows only the occasional resentment of having more responsibilities around the house, and lives quite comfortably under all the strict rules about who and what can come into our home. Both she and Andy are very careful about not bringing anything in which might affect me and if they think that might be the case, they immediately change their clothes and have a bath.\nIn this passage we see how family members represent the body of the chemically reactive by changing their diets and social calendars, assuming additional domestic tasks, monitoring who comes into the house, and abiding by strict hygiene habits to prevent the outdoors from coming in. It is in these small but important ways that the environmentally ill body becomes a model for the family.\nIn addition to changing their personal habits and routines, some spouses and partners become social activists, representing the chemically reactive body to broader publics. A disability rights expert with MCS reports: “My boyfriend is usually very supportive. He tells his friends about my illness and my limitations. This is very helpful.” A retired forestry executive writes about his wife: “Janice learned as much about MCS as I did and speaks to people about it. She gave a talk about chemicals and the body at our public library last month.” Andy, the partner of the producer and director encountered above, “has always been a social and now environmental activist and often speaks out about MCS and its victims, especially in our present battle to keep chlorine out of our town’s water system.” An otherwise healthy person who identifies with MCS by advocating for its legitimacy as a real disease ensures the chemically reactive one more voice in their struggle for recognition.\nMany of the environmentally ill, however, are not as lucky as these already made plans, depending on my condition.
