Although they all gained greater understanding and considerable experience with the value, uses, and range of digital tools available for instruction (as reflected in Chapter 3), their confidence and competence in actually mediating student learning with digital technology were uneven. To capture more of what was possible in terms of the learning of students at the school, I highlighted work in Ms. Foster and Ms. Glide's classes. In this section, I discuss key characteristics of the V-Tech teachers' learning with the understanding that there were differential levels of comfort in their attempts to implement what they were learning about uses of technology in instruction over the course of the academic year.\nIt was important that the teachers learned new perspectives about teaching as well as new teaching practices. Obviously, the two go hand in hand, yet the CREDE standards were important for teaching with or without high levels of technology use. Importantly, work with the CREDE standards helped change perspectives on teaching in ways that facilitated possibilities for greater use of digital tools. In other words, specific knowledge and skills with technology were only part of what was needed for effective instruction. The pedagogical knowledge that teachers needed to implement the CREDE standards was also crucial. For example, in his math class, Mr. Guy used joint productive activities and instructional dialogues for challenging and complex tasks in trigonometry that also connected across disciplines to his students' prior knowledge and experiences, all in conjunction with the digital affordances of Google Earth. The perspective on joint productive activities along with project-based learning, in fact, undergirded our PD approach and allowed us to focus the teachers' learning on their actual work in classrooms. Yet, since very little use of digital tools was going on in most of the teachers' classrooms, there also had to be a balance of addressing learning to use various digital tools in the PD sessions and then attempting to support their implementation in the teachers' practices. This was the key challenge—the actual implementation of what the teachers were learning.\nIn this regard, Ms. Church noted, “I feel like I'm that teacher who doesn't get any of this into the classroom. I still feel apprehensive. I just like to be in my classroom where I can control how things go.” Yet she "},"document":{"title":"Digital Tools in Urban Schools: Mediating a Remix of Learning","author":"Mahiri, Jabari","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":28,"isbn":"9780472027606"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":6957,"display_name":"CREDE principles -- and changes in perspectives on teaching"},"id":22737,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":7116,"display_name":"instructional conversations -- in Google Earth math class"},"id":23132,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":7128,"display_name":"joint productive activity -- in Google Earth math class"},"id":23153,"ring_next":5851,"ring_prev":5851},{"basket":{"id":7064,"display_name":"math class -- use of Google Earth in"},"id":23263,"ring_next":5847,"ring_prev":5877},{"basket":{"id":7217,"display_name":"pedagogical knowledge, teachers and"},"id":23341,"ring_next":5847,"ring_prev":5850},{"basket":{"id":7256,"display_name":"professional development (PD) sessions -- implementation of lessons learned in"},"id":23430,"ring_next":5828,"ring_prev":5845},{"basket":{"id":7257,"display_name":"professional development (PD) sessions -- joint productive activity in"},"id":23434,"ring_next":5851,"ring_prev":5853},{"basket":{"id":7338,"display_name":"teaching practices -- changing"},"id":23651,"ring_next":5833,"ring_prev":5882},{"basket":{"id":7358,"display_name":"TEACH Project -- teacher learning in"},"id":23707,"ring_next":5798,"ring_prev":5833}],"localid":"page_135","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap05.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_135\">","css_selector":"#page_135","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_135\"]"},"next_location_id":5928,"previous_location_id":5926}]
