The report was well-documented and provoked an instant reaction from Chinese authorities, always prepared for crisis management, in which they announced that local officials would be punished, businesses closed, and the contracts immediately terminated.\nOne of the striking features of the report is the way in which it shows how traditional IOC rhetoric can be deployed to create a frame for altering narratives. Quoting directly from extracts of the IOC's Code of Ethics, PlayFair invoked the following principles:\n1. Safeguarding the dignity of the individual is a fundamental requirement of Olympism.\n…\n5.

In that agreement, “the IOC and the ILO undertake to encourage activities in pursuit of this objective, particularly those which contribute to the elimination of poverty and child labour …” (PlayFair 2008 2007, 6).\nInvoking this history, PlayFair urged the IOC to “Adopt a clear and public statement, including inclusion into the Olympic Charter, in\n"},"document":{"title":"Owning the Olympics: Narratives of the New China","author":"Price, Monroe E.; Dayan, Daniel","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":9,"isbn":"9780472024506"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1808,"display_name":"Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad (BOCOG) -- and IPR"},"id":5125,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1926,"display_name":"International Olympic Committee (IOC) -- and Code of Ethics"},"id":5569,"ring_next":1491,"ring_prev":1565},{"basket":{"id":1935,"display_name":"International Olympic Committee (IOC) -- and labor conditions"},"id":5596,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1923,"display_name":"Olympic Charter"},"id":5893,"ring_next":1584,"ring_prev":1559}],"localid":"page_101","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/10_chap03.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_101\">","css_selector":"#page_101","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_101\"]"},"next_location_id":1567,"previous_location_id":1565}]
