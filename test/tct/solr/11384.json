Courts were quick to enjoin concerted employee conduct, and they swiftly punished those who dared to disobey their proscriptive orders. When state or federal legislatures enacted laws providing minimal employment protections for workers, employer groups successfully challenged the constitutionality of those enactments.87\nIn 1935, the Federal Government established organizational and negotiating rights for workers under the National Labor Relations Act.88 After businesses failed in their attempt to have this law invalidated,89 many companies resorted to unlawful tactics. For example, numerous firms created their own “labor organizations” and installed pro-management persons as the officers of those “company unions.”90 Although such employer-dominated institutions contravened the specific prohibition contained in Section 8(2) of the NLRA, those devices enabled many employers to prevent employee unionization by independent labor organizations for several years.\nAs businesses became accustomed to the rights and obligations set forth in the NLRA, one might reasonably have anticipated a reduction in illegal behavior. On the contrary, the number of unfair labor practice charges filed against companies under Section 8(a)(1),91 which proscribes employer restraint or coercion of employees with respect to their concerted activity, rose from about 4,500 in 1955 to over 31,000 in 1980.92 Even though the number of Section 8(a)(1) charges declined to 22,500 in 1985, much of this decrease may be attributed to the reduction in union organizing campaigns during the 1980s. In 1980, the Labor Board conducted 7,296 representation elections, but in 1985, it held only 3,749.93 While not all unfair labor practice charges are sustained in Labor Board adjudications, a seven-fold increase in alleged violations between 1955 and 1980 is remarkable. Many of those cases undoubtedly involved employer threats to take adverse action against workers who either engaged in informal collective action or contemplated actual unionization.\nThe NLRB data with regard to retaliatory discharges in violation of Section 8(a)(3)94 are equally disturbing. Such discriminatory terminations, usually of the most vocal labor organization supporters, represent the most potent anti-union weapon available to employers. If a company is able to eliminate the key organizers during the early stages of a union campaign, the remaining employees generally become extremely hesitant to exhibit enthusiasm for the selection of a bargaining representative. In 1957, the Labor Board directed the "},"document":{"title":"Can Unions Survive?","author":"charles b.craver","publisher":"New York University Press","id":46,"isbn":"9780814715123"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":17317,"display_name":"Company unions"},"id":48071,"ring_next":11438,"ring_prev":11465},{"basket":{"id":17546,"display_name":"Wagner Act National Labor Relations Board"},"id":48440,"ring_next":11410,"ring_prev":11382},{"basket":{"id":17547,"display_name":"National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)"},"id":48454,"ring_next":11385,"ring_prev":11371},{"basket":{"id":17561,"display_name":"Organizing campaigns"},"id":48486,"ring_next":11385,"ring_prev":11385},{"basket":{"id":17619,"display_name":"Retaliation"},"id":48596,"ring_next":11405,"ring_prev":11405},{"basket":{"id":17691,"display_name":"Unfair labor practices -- charges"},"id":48714,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_48","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch03.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_48\">","css_selector":"#page_48","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_48\"]"},"next_location_id":11385,"previous_location_id":11383}]
