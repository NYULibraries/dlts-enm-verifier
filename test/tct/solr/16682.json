Rawls’s liberalism differs from that of Kant or Mill, for example, precisely because of its insulation from metaphysical commitments and comprehensive moral doctrines. Unlike Kant’s or Mill’s, Rawls’s liberalism does not rest upon (though it aims to encompass) moral ideals of individuality and autonomy, with their strong metaphysical presuppositions. The detachment of justice as fairness from such doctrines and presuppositions is, once again, motivated by practical considerations rooted in our history. Political philosophy must take as its point of departure the brute historical fact of rival moral outlooks and philosophical viewpoints in our society. This fact disqualifies from serious consideration any political position, including that adopted in many liberal theories, that tries to argue away these intractable differences and which postulates agreement or convergence where none exists.10\nRawls’s variant of contractarian method has clear advantages over others. It seems superior to Gauthier’s version, which (despite its many important achievements in developing the con-tractarian project) is burdened by a conception of practical reasoning as maximization whose rationale is obscure, and which sets itself the heroic task of giving morality itself a contractarian reconstruction. Rawls’s position in contractarian method is preferable because it acknowledges explicitly the status of the key notions of his theory as practical and normative constructions. I will refer in the last section to the relations between such constructions and the empirical or anthropological propositions that they stand upon or presuppose. At this stage, I wish to argue only that the method of construction of the key terms in contract theory appears to have significant advantages over a method in which they are treated in quasi-naturalistic (but hardly realistic)11 fashion. Further, Rawls’s method has a real advantage over Gauthier’s inasmuch as its goal is the contractarian reconstruction, not of morality, but of political justice. It seems inherently improbable that a contractarian analysis can be given of the whole of moral life, and the conception of philosophical inquiry as having a practical character—as consisting in a search "},"document":{"title":"Markets and Justice","author":"John W.
