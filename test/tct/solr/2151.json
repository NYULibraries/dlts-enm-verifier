As a working hypothesis, across the industrialized world at this particular moment, one would certainly predict the economic field to be dominant. But contra Marx, this is not the result of any historical necessity; it is just, in Weberian fashion, the contingent result of a path-dependent historical process. How dominant the economic field will be, how autonomous the opposing fields of cultural production will be, and how the realms of the economic and cultural are understood would certainly be expected to vary cross-nationally. In the industrialized West, especially in western Europe, the artistic and scientific “cultural” fields will constitute the primary opposition to the economic field; however, in many countries the religious field may be the major opposing field or even the dominant field. In some countries, the military or command-economy political fields may be dominant. Thus, in Bourdieu’s field theory, a basic structural framework posited to have universal validity is balanced, at least partially, by an open-ended investigation of the particular empirical forms that these structures will take in any given social realm.\nIndeed, field theory is already being put to use in fruitful ways for a variety of studies beyond the Anglo-American or French orbits (e.g., Kjær & Slaatta, 2007; Hovden, 2008; Hallin & Mancini, 2004), as well as comparative studies that demonstrate the persistence of national field logics against the supposed homogenizing force of Americanization (e.g., Benson & Hallin, 2007; Benson, Blach-Ørsten, Powers, Willig, & Vera Zambrano, 2012; Benson, 2013). In recent years, field theory also has been adopted usefully for scholarship of the global South.2\nOrayb Najjar (2007) draws on field theory for a study of the rise of transnational news media outlets like Al Jazeera (Arabic and International) in Qatar and TeleSur in Venezuela. Najjar goes beyond a straight political economy account to emphasize, in Bourdieuian fashion, distinctions between funding (economic capital) and legitimacy (symbolic capital), and the relational basis of all symbolic claims to legitimacy. Najjar takes seriously field theory’s insistence that field relations extend beyond national boundaries, as when Bourdieu (1998b, p. 41) remarks that for a journalistic field analysis to be complete “the position of the national media field within the global media field would have to be taken into account.”\nIn Najjar’s study of Al Jazeera and TeleSur, field structure and dynamics are shown to be a product of history, which in the case of global media must take into account the global South’s long-simmering dissatisfaction\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1024,"display_name":"Al Jazeera"},"id":6308,"ring_next":6287,"ring_prev":2149},{"basket":{"id":2117,"display_name":"Arab, Arabic"},"id":6323,"ring_next":1899,"ring_prev":2149},{"basket":{"id":2131,"display_name":"Benson, Rodney"},"id":6419,"ring_next":1898,"ring_prev":2146},{"basket":{"id":6908,"display_name":"Bourdieu, Pierre"},"id":6451,"ring_next":2152,"ring_prev":2150},{"basket":{"id":2219,"display_name":"Field theory -- Fields of production"},"id":6979,"ring_next":1903,"ring_prev":2114},{"basket":{"id":2221,"display_name":"Field theory -- Symbolic capital"},"id":6982,"ring_next":2152,"ring_prev":2152},{"basket":{"id":2167,"display_name":"Hallin, Daniel, & Mancini, Paolo"},"id":7129,"ring_next":1905,"ring_prev":2103},{"basket":{"id":2369,"display_name":"Political economy"},"id":7931,"ring_next":2155,"ring_prev":2052},{"basket":{"id":2098,"display_name":"Weber, Max"},"id":8338,"ring_next":13138,"ring_prev":2149}],"localid":"page_264","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter13.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_264\">","css_selector":"#page_264","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_264\"]"},"next_location_id":2152,"previous_location_id":2150}]
