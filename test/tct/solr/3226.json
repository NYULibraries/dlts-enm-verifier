More precisely, however, the enigmatic action of turtle-tagging converted the city's surfaces into mirrors that reflected the the city's own collective sense of itself. The “slowness” ascribed to the turtle-tagger, outed by the Detroit Free Press in 2004 as the graffiti artist, Ronald Scherz, was actually a product of the artist's audience. This audience saw an image they themselves projected onto turtles—the image of a city historically constructed on the basis of mobility and speed but one currently defined by torpor and inacitivity.\n"},"document":{"title":"The Unreal Estate Guide to Detroit","author":"Herscher, Andrew","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":15,"isbn":"9780472029174"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_140","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/pt02_chp03.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_140\">","css_selector":"#page_140","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_140\"]"},"next_location_id":3227,"previous_location_id":3225}]
