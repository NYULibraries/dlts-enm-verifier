[{"id":29068,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"103-page_63","content_descriptor":"page 63","text":"Celskiii’s and Rey-Jun’s comments demonstrate a politicized understanding of the ways in which blackness is not simply a signifier of what is considered “hip” or “cool” but also a site of political identification and contestation. In Celskiii’s case, she points out that underlying the universalization of hip-hop is its mass commodification while in Rey-Jun’s case, he points out that the depoliticization of hip-hop is inextricably linked to its mass commodification.\nConclusion\nIn problematizing the claims of my respondents and the underlying basis for their claims, I do not mean to argue that hip-hop is the absolute or specific cultural property of African Americans because they created it, or to argue that the participation of nonblack practitioners and participants have brought about a “dilution” of hip-hop as a function of their purported distance from hip-hop’s point of origin. Rather, my goal is to argue for a much more complex understanding of culture, one that takes into account the tensions and ambiguities inherent in the traversing of cultural boundaries. It is to argue for the need to interrogate what it means to deploy the signifier “black” in relation to hip-hop today, given hip-hop’s diffusion on a global scale. I am particularly interested in the question of what it means to account for the global diffusion of hip-hop without losing sight of its “black” origins and continued “black” influence. How do we hold these two in a productive tension? What does the appeal to “roots” and “origins” signify in this context and to what effect? Does an appeal to roots and origins render illegitimate any forms and practices that do not emerge from the original context of hip-hop? Are all appeals to roots and origins necessarily suspect? What is obscured by the impossibility or irrelevance of origins? What are the politics at stake?43\nThe tendency, particularly with regard to black expressive forms and practices, is to conceive of the kinds of intercultural exchanges that take place as an issue simply of appropriation or a cultural “free-for-all.” In other words, black culture is conceived simply as something to be plundered, or a level of equivalence is assumed among the different groups of youth participating. In either case, black culture is located outside history and disentangled from politics. Overlooked are the specificities of the groups in question—their status and positionality—as well as the ways culture remains linked to race despite efforts to obscure this connection.\n\n"},"document":{"title":"FILIPINOS REPRESENT","author":"Antonio T.
