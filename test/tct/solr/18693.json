William James describes the religious speculations of the deaf-and-dumb boy d’Estrella, who thought, before he learned to understand any language, that there were many suns, one for each day, and that the moon, which seemed to follow him everywhere, was his dead mother, because, while his mother had lived, he had never seen the moon (James 1892).\nThe temptation to distinguish between language and thought becomes even stronger when one considers the testimony given by persons who have suffered injury to their brains and recovered from the subsequent aphasia, at least enough to describe what their condition was before the injury. One such person reports, “First I formulate the idea in my mind and then I try to express the idea in the language and then I have the problem. I can get the idea real quickly but to make it into language or express it as language … I just couldn’t do it” (Gardner 1974, 406–7). Another such person says, “For the most part my perception is that I am more capable of thinking things through than explaining them in words. … I know what I want to say but cannot get at the words at that particular moment” (Gardner 1974, 411–12).\nThe wounded Russian, whose sadly heroic case is described by A. R. Luria, writes (slowly and painfully) that he would get an idea of how to describe the moment when he was wounded and the period just after it, when his aphasic illness began. “At last,” he writes, “I’d turned up a good idea. So I began to hunt for words to describe it and finally I thought of two. By the time I got to the third word, I was stuck. … I’d try to clamp the words to the idea as much as I could. But what a torture it was.” Elsewhere he says, in the same vein, “There always seems to be a gap between a word and its meaning. These two are always disconnected and I have to yoke them together somehow” (Luria 1972, 79–80, 106).\nAnother reason for my feeling about languages is more personal. I have been bilingual almost from the start.
