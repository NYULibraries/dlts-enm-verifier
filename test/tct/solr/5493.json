Exploring technics across the supposed print/digital divide, these literary texts clearly refuse the positioning of literary print cultures outside or in opposition to U.S. digital cultures. More importantly, their comparative media practices proceed to register through their expressive processes, and to reflect on, digital cultures’ inclination and capacities to re- and dematerialize defining elements of our biological, economic, cultural, and social lives. They begin to come to terms with the fact that in contemporary late capitalism “the world of things has become a world of signs—a universe that both brings into being and is brought into being by symbolic codes.”6 Writer Steve Tomasula suggests that “perhaps it is for this reason alone that that most symbolic of all codes, the literary text, can foreshadow a future world while the contemporary world suggests the future of poetics.”7 He remarks on the reciprocal interplay between literary text and extraliterary world that now involves the literary’s anticipation of the significantly symbolic operations of the real world of finance capital and futures trading while the real world of things seems on the verge of outmaneuvering the poetic in the creativity, dynamism, and affective power of its symbolic, world-building maneuvers. At the core of these influential relays between the literary and its environments is this broader intertwining and interplay between symbolic and material processes today that confounds previous, oppositional understandings of the symbolic and material (and the cultural and economic spheres with which they are respectively aligned).\nIn this context, comparative media practices, involved in a similar transposition of symbolic practices from one medium to another, or a transposition that engages the material preconditions of digital or print media to divergent symbolic, expressive ends, can be understood as a poetic method "},"document":{"title":"Tactics of the Human: Experimental Technics in American Fiction","author":"Shackelford, Laura","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":26,"isbn":"9780472120680"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":6592,"display_name":"comparative media practices -- as comparative technics"},"id":21261,"ring_next":5498,"ring_prev":5491},{"basket":{"id":6609,"display_name":"digital literary"},"id":21354,"ring_next":5497,"ring_prev":5298},{"basket":{"id":6626,"display_name":"experimental technics"},"id":21421,"ring_next":5283,"ring_prev":5488},{"basket":{"id":6669,"display_name":"Jackson, Shelley -- Patchwork Girl by Mary/Shelley and Herself"},"id":21598,"ring_next":5495,"ring_prev":5488},{"basket":{"id":6851,"display_name":"Tomasula, Steve"},"id":22502,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_215","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap006.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_215\">","css_selector":"#page_215","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_215\"]"},"next_location_id":5494,"previous_location_id":5492}]
