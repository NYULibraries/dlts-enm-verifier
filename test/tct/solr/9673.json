The first two of these are very good questions indeed; as I hope to have made clear thus far, I would like to inhabit a profession that asks them in the most rigorous possible manner. But the third question is a strict non sequitur; it even contains a non sequitur within a non sequitur. For if in fact it is not possible to constitute literature as a distinct category of writing (and many minds finer than mine have tried to do just this), there is no reason to assume that the subject of literary study is therefore ideology (whatever “ideology” might mean in this context); and even if the subject of literary study were ideology, there would be no warrant for eliding the study of ideology with the goal of political transformation. Many professors in history and political science, I believe, manage to study ideology without demanding to see their students’ voting records at the end of the semester. In the course of only a few lines, then, Levine has moved from asking fundamental and indispensable questions about the donnee of the discipline to caricaturing politically committed criticism in terms as reductive and (mis) leading as New Criterion boilerplate.\nLevine then moves to more specific targets, naming Fredric Jameson, Edward Said, Stephen Greenblatt, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick as examples of politically committed readers. But as Levine immediately adds, his quarrel is not with these people, whom he credits with having “wonderfully enriched the possibilities of literary criticism”; his quarrel is with “their followers” who “reduce critical practice to exercises in political posturing” (2). Here again is that distinctive generational anxiety, the impulse to scorn the sort now growing up, all out of shape from toe to top: their parents had some redeeming qualities, but evidently those qualities were recessive, for the children display only the vices of their elders in exaggerated form. Yet three pages later, it turns out that Levine does have a quarrel with Sedgwick after all. Calling her work “a rich and illuminating criticism that makes literature more, not less interesting,” he nonetheless registers a complaint about its purpose: “like much of the best criticism today, it is, however, using literature primarily as a means to broad cultural conclusions” (5).
