Thus, Russian political prisoner Vera Figner describes the calm and radiance of the prisoner who realizes that the moment of her test has come.14 And Jawaharlal Nehru writes of his wife Kamala’s arrest in 1931: “I was pleased, for she had so longed to follow many of her comrades to prison.”15 In the contemporary United States, street youths often want to go to prison to prove their toughness. For the same reason, some of them prefer a prison such as Attica or Stateville to a “softer” facility.16\nA particularly interesting example of prison as a rite of passage appears in John Edgar Wideman’s nonfictional book, Brothers and Keepers.17 Wideman, a professor and successful author, sets out to understand the divergence between his fate and the fate of his brother Robby, who is serving a life term for felony murder. Toward the end of his book, Wideman comments on the prisoner’s grace—a grace he attributes to his brother’s suffering behind the walls:\n\nIn prison Robby had achieved an inner calm, a degree of self-sufficiency and self-reliance never apparent when he was running the streets. I didn’t know many people, inside or out, who carried themselves the way he did now. Like my mother, he’d grown accustomed to what was unbearable, had named it, tamed it. He’d fallen, but he’d found the strength to rise again. Inch by inch, hand over hand, he’d pulled himself up on a vine he’d never known was there, a vine still invisible to me. . . . To discover the source of my brother’s strength I found myself comparing what I’d accomplished outside the walls with what he’d managed inside. The comparison made me uncomfortable.18\n\nHere, the successful civilian feels threatened by what he perceives to be the prisoner’s achievement. The vine, which Wideman imagines his convict-brother climbing, is a symbol of Christianity; specifically, in the Gospel of John, the vine becomes a metaphor for Christ.19\nInsofar as it is perceived as a rite of passage, incarceration confers a status on those who experience it. Imprisonment is thought to afford a special insight, attainable only to the initiated.
