It attempts to apply these principles to the highly complex and increasingly globalized world. A range of socially engaged perspectives are outlined including those from Nagarjuna, the Dalai Lama, Thich Nhat Hanh, Sulak Sivaraksa, and the Think Sangha.\nDissanayake (2006, 2011) argues for a new concept of humanism: “Humanism as generally understood in Western discourse . . . places at the center of its interest the sovereign individual—the individual who is self-present, the originator of action and meaning, and the privileged location of human values and civilizational achievements. However, the concept of the self and individual that is textualized in the kind of classical works that attract the attention of Asian communication theorists present a substantially different picture. The ontology and axiology of selfhood found in Buddhism differs considerably from those associated with European humanism. What these differences signpost is that there is not one but many humanisms” (Dissanayake, 2006, 6).\nMany humanisms may lead to what Appiah calls the cosmopolitan challenge: “If we accept the cosmopolitan challenge, we will tell our representatives that we want them to remember those strangers. Not because we are moved by their suffering—we may or may not be—but because we are responsive to what Adam Smith called “reason, principle, conscience, the inhabitant of the beast.” The people of the richest nations can do better. This is a demand of simple morality. But it is one that will resonate more widely if we make our civilization more cosmopolitan” (Appiah, 2006, p. 174).\nBy Way of Conclusion: “Internationalize” Media Education\nThese are some of the “problems” and “constraints” a genuine “internationalizing” of international communication may have to come to grips with. However, an equally important “internationalization” may need to take place in journalism and media education.\nProfessional education (of journalists and others) continues to be based on local or national parameters. It has to break out of its national carcass and internationalize. One of the central questions is “how do we escape national stereotypes in journalism education? How do we break the mode of a nationally biased understanding of media and news?” More multicultural and international “authentic” learning experiences, more innovative and critical reflection, more problem solving, social negotiation of information\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2121,"display_name":"Asia"},"id":6336,"ring_next":1983,"ring_prev":1967},{"basket":{"id":2280,"display_name":"Internationalize (or internationalizing)\n\ninternational communication"},"id":7323,"ring_next":1997,"ring_prev":1911},{"basket":{"id":295,"display_name":"journalism"},"id":7404,"ring_next":1969,"ring_prev":1965},{"basket":{"id":2319,"display_name":"Media education"},"id":7571,"ring_next":1969,"ring_prev":1969},{"basket":{"id":2386,"display_name":"Professional journalism, professionalization of journalism (news, media) -- Education"},"id":8007,"ring_next":1980,"ring_prev":2075}],"localid":"page_81","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter04.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_81\">","css_selector":"#page_81","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_81\"]"},"next_location_id":1969,"previous_location_id":1967}]
