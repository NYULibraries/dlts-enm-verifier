What he projects before him as his ideal is the substitute for the lost narcissism of his childhood in which he was his own ideal” (94). Yet, a positive, or aggrandized, ego ideal cannot compensate for the absence of real sources of gratification—in the form of genuine love—from others. Freud concluded that “idealization is a process that concerns the object; by it that object, without any alteration in its nature, is aggrandized and exalted in the subject’s mind” (94). In other words, other people compensate for the individual’s own sense of personal frustration and dissatisfaction. The qualities one wishes for oneself—qualities that might, in turn, be exalted by others—are projected onto someone else.\nIt isn’t difficult to appreciate how children, who rely on the comfort of idealizing phantasies to cope with the pain of their inherently frustrating emancipation, would resort to the same tendency when they grow older: to idealize other people as a way of procuring love, in phantasy. All analysts are an object for such idealization by their patients. In fact, the more we repress our desires, the more likely we will idealize others as a compensation. “Being loved” becomes a substitute for one’s impoverished capacity to love. This is why the tendency to idealize others is an essential component of “falling in love.” Idealizing is a magical transformation of one’s world. It has the power to circumvent repressions by elevating the sexual object into a benefactor. “Since, with the object type (or attachment type), being in love occurs in virtue of the fulfillment of infantile conditions for loving, we may say that whatever fulfills that condition is idealized” (101). In other words, “What possesses the excellence which the ego lacks for making it an ideal, is loved” (101).\nNeurotics, who feel unloved and, in turn, are afraid to love, are in an impossible situation. They blame others for their impoverishment, yet long for them to relieve it. The analyst, the object of their “transferences,” becomes the ideal for this confused devotion. They hope the analyst can save them from their agony of isolation, to be their companion. The cure they envision is one that isn’t, however, the culmination of ceaseless effort, but rather a salvation at the instigation of a higher power. “This is a cure by love, which he [the neurotic] generally prefers to cure by "},"document":{"title":"The truth about  Freud’s technique","author":"M.
