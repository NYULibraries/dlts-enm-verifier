The arrival of computer technologies has provided new ways to support interactivity in our teaching.\nOur students require it: there has always been a world wide web for the undergraduates in our classes. Personal computers were first introduced en masse into primary and secondary education in the 1980s, and those students have already graduated from university. Computers went, in the span of a few years, from being a rarity to a commonplace. We now live in an age of “pervasive computing,”1 in which digital devices proliferate into every corner of our lives. Students interact with this technology less like a tool (something to get the job done) and more like a musical instrument (something with which to be creative). The key aesthetic of computing today is not keyboarding, or re-creating previous media in digital format, but rather, content creation, mash-ups, and remixes: in short, interactivity.2 Several years ago a 2007 Demos Report surveyed primary-and secondary-level students and parents in the United Kingdom and created focus groups to study the digital impact of new media on their day-to-day lives and especially their learning environments. The key finding was that for young people (today’s university "},"document":{"title":"Pastplay: Teaching and Learning History with Technology","author":"Kee, Kevin","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":1,"isbn":"9780472120482"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":105,"display_name":"interactive"},"id":390,"ring_next":300,"ring_prev":238},{"basket":{"id":112,"display_name":"learning -- students'"},"id":438,"ring_next":293,"ring_prev":271},{"basket":{"id":148,"display_name":"pervasive games"},"id":552,"ring_next":296,"ring_prev":114},{"basket":{"id":201,"display_name":"teaching -- with technology"},"id":724,"ring_next":31,"ring_prev":268}],"localid":"page_270","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter13.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_270\">","css_selector":"#page_270","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_270\"]"},"next_location_id":279,"previous_location_id":277}]
