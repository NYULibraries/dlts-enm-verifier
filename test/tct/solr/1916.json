Whereupon I demurred, protesting that I hardly know anything about international communication and certainly nothing about internationalizing it. CC persisted, however, and challenged me to reconsider my own research and writing and to decide which of us is right. We made a bet, so to speak, for which the cost (at least to me) is that I have spent the past six months trying to decide whether I have any standing in this field. He said that it would be OK, as an oldtimer, if I were to share whatever I found, even autobiographically. It occurred to me only later that CC might be worrying that he had asked the wrong person to write an introduction to his book on media imperialism (Lee, 1980) some thirty-five years ago!\nSo, let us do exactly that. In part 1 of what follows, I will unashamedly review what I think I have done that might qualify me in international communication, even if, at the time, I did not think of this work as explicitly international. I will do this chronologically, more or less, as if I were searching my CV for keywords. Following which, in part 2, I will try to make some observations about what, if anything, I have learned on this narcissistic safari, as I try to find meaning in the series of relevant projects\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2231,"display_name":"Giddens, Anthony"},"id":7025,"ring_next":2115,"ring_prev":24096},{"basket":{"id":2268,"display_name":"International communication research -- Cultural relevance in"},"id":7299,"ring_next":2088,"ring_prev":1907},{"basket":{"id":2183,"display_name":"media imperialism"},"id":7578,"ring_next":1931,"ring_prev":2045}],"localid":"page_29","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter02.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_29\">","css_selector":"#page_29","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_29\"]"},"next_location_id":1917,"previous_location_id":1915}]
