It was Freud himself who established the elaborate and enormously complicated diagnostic criteria that now serve as the foundation for contemporary psychoanalytic nomenclature. In fact, it’s hard to imagine what a psychoanalytic treatment would look like without its customary diagnostic presuppositions. But Freud tended to paint his canvas with broad strokes and, as we know, when it came to making distinctions—whether between one form of neurosis and another, or between vast regions of pathologies, the neuroses and psychoses—things became distinctly ambiguous. It’s ironic that the analytic community, in its evolution since Freud, has become increasingly intolerant of those ambiguities, an aversion that is itself sometimes associated with obsessionality!\nAnd what would Freud make of the “newer” pathologies that have recently emerged, the narcissistic and borderline conditions? More and more it seems that every neurotic, on closer examination, is a closet narcissistic or borderline type. Increasingly, neurosis, as an entity for treatment, is disappearing. It seems that the only place we are sure to encounter a hysteric or obsessional neurotic is amongst analytic candidates in training—both the patients being treated and their therapists. What accounts for the gradual disappearance of the typical, classical neurotic in contemporary analytic literature? Perhaps the following observations will prove suggestive:\n\n1. Our Western culture—particularly American culture—seems to be fascinated with the concept of narcissism. Its features are easily recognized in virtually all neurotics, but until recently they hadn’t seemed as prevalent, nor did they appear to be specifically “pathological.” Freud, for example, refused to equate lying or other aspects of poor character—typical features of these newer pathologies—with psychopathology, per se; nor did he believe they were treatable. While this diagnosis is becoming increasingly fashionable, it’s acknowledged that its curability is dubious at best. Nonetheless, its newfound acceptance in the analytic community as a treatable diagnosis conveniently opens the door to thousands of previously “unanalyzable” patients.\n2. More and more, the typical candidate for analytic training is identifiable as an “obsessional type”: serious, determined to succeed, dedicated to a mission, self-sacrificing, humorless, resourceful, studious.
