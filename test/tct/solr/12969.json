The status of slaves in transit and nonresident runaway slaves was not before the high court of Massachusetts in Cushing’s day. Those issues were addressed by Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw’s court in the nineteenth century. See Leonard W. Levy, The Law of the Commonwealth and Chief Justice Shaw (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1957), 59-108.\n86. See generally Saul Cornell, “Early American History in a Postmodern Age,” William and Mary Quarterly 50 (April 1993): 329-41.\n87. A story that is reported in the biographical accounts of Cushing’s life with almost as much frequency as the story about his making a list of materials he would need for a new suit is one about how Cushing was the last American judge to wear the full-bottomed English judicial wig.\n88. Marshall’s contributions are well summarized by Johnson: (1) establishing the “opinion of the Court” as the major vehicle for announcing the Court’s decisions; (2) insisting upon “collegial decorum” among the justices; and (3) encouraging the justices to share expertise, to work together for the good of the Court, and to be sensitive to the abilities and limitations of their brethren.

Johnson, The Chief Justiceship of John Marshall, 1801-1835 (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1997).\n\n\n"},"document":{"title":"Seriatim","author":"John Marshall","publisher":"New York University Press","id":51,"isbn":"9780814731437"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":19955,"display_name":"Johnson, Herbert -- on John Marshall"},"id":54668,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":20023,"display_name":"Marshall, John -- significance of"},"id":54833,"ring_next":12845,"ring_prev":12961},{"basket":{"id":20034,"display_name":"Massachusetts -- and slavery"},"id":55018,"ring_next":12959,"ring_prev":12959}],"localid":"page_125","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chapter4.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_125\">","css_selector":"#page_125","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_125\"]"},"next_location_id":12970,"previous_location_id":12968}]
