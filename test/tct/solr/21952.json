And if conscience can be cultivated—if our inner nag changes in response to changes in our moral beliefs and patterns of moral reasoning—then the sociological account can prod us to reexamine and change our approach to moral education.\nDeflationary accounts of conscience reveal how the interior experience of moral life takes different forms reflecting specific cultural and psychological conditions and processes. Applying these insights to Kant would prompt us to consider whether the austerity of his account of conscience is a vision of morality we want to embrace in ourselves and nurture in others. Thus the sociological turn in theories of conscience offers incentives and resources for moral self-scrutiny.\nIV.\nI have raised questions about whether Kant’s account of conscience is a uniquely and unambiguously attractive moral ideal and whether the options that Hill describes represent a comprehensive picture of conceptions of conscience. I do, however, find the Kantian call to reflection and self-scrutiny morally persuasive and inspiring. There is a vivid sense in Kant’s account of the many ways in which we, as moral agents, can fall short—and this is surely valid and important. As the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska put it in a wonderful poem entitled “In Praise of Feeling Bad about Yourself,”\nThe buzzard never says it is to blame\nThe panther wouldn’t know what scruples mean\nWhen the piranha strikes, it feels no shame\nIf snakes had hands, they’d claim their hands were clean\n…\nThough hearts of killer whales may weigh a ton\nin every other way they’re light\nOn this third planet of the Sun\namong the signs of bestiality\na clear conscience is Number One.7 \n"},"document":{"title":"Integrity and Conscience","author":"Ian Shapiro","publisher":"New York University Press","id":81,"isbn":"9780814780978"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":33268,"display_name":"Moral disagreement"},"id":84048,"ring_next":21885,"ring_prev":21943},{"basket":{"id":33354,"display_name":"Szymborska, Wislawa"},"id":84349,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_75","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch04.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_75\">","css_selector":"#page_75","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_75\"]"},"next_location_id":21953,"previous_location_id":21951}]
