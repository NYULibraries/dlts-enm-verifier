Massage parlors, nightclubs, bars, and other prostitution outlets were closed down, their windows and doors boarded. The mayor offered incentives to investors to encourage the startup of new businesses. But Manila has offered nothing to the women, for whom there are no social support systems, and thus this potentially far-reaching reform has been turned into another victimization of bar women. They are not only exploited by the men who buy them but also by government prohibition of the businesses in which men buy women.\nThe 1992–93 reorganization of prostitution in the Philippines reveals plans to close down the sex industry in some areas, such as Manila, and redevelop it in others. The complete disregard for the welfare, future, and legitimate economic development of prostitute women establishes the base for the continued proliferation of prostitution.\nIn the Philippines, women have been advertised to foreigners as “Little Brown Fucking Machines.” In a 1990 study by the Women’s Education, Development, Productivity, and Research Organization, in the Philippines, it was found that there are 3 classes of prostitution: Generally migrants from depressed regions in the Philippines, the lowest class consists of casa workers, all of whom are migrants registered as food handlers; they live in brothels, are not allowed to leave, and must take any customers as they arrive. The next are bar girls, who are formally registered as employees of bars but receive no salary. They live at the bar and earn money by encouraging men to buy drinks and, from there, to buy their bodies. Then there are the streetwalkers, who are controlled by pimps. Their work is illegal because they are unregistered. Depending on their pimps, they may be more or less advantaged by working fewer hours, having to take fewer customers, and possibly receiving a better cut from the pimp than the girls in bars or casas receive.63\n"},"document":{"title":"The Prostitution of Sexuality","author":"Kathleen Barry","publisher":"New york University Press","id":73,"isbn":"9780814712771"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":28652,"display_name":"Philippines -- casa workers"},"id":74815,"ring_next":19591,"ring_prev":19591},{"basket":{"id":29490,"display_name":"Women's Education, Development, Productivity, and Research Organization (Philippines)"},"id":75498,"ring_next":19589,"ring_prev":19589}],"localid":"page_149","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch04.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_149\">","css_selector":"#page_149","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_149\"]"},"next_location_id":19591,"previous_location_id":19589}]
