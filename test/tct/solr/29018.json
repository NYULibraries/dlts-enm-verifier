A select number of these works directly engage with the foregoing debates and discussions, foregrounding the prominence of race in shaping the dynamics and discourses of hip-hop. I want to focus in particular on Nitasha Tamar Sharma’s Hip-hop Desis and Anthony Kwame Harrison’s Hip-hop Underground because their engagement with race speaks to the complexities and challenges of making sense of contemporary racial politics through a consideration of hip-hop. Like my own work, these works operate from the assumption that hip-hop constitutes a highly racialized terrain utilized by various groups of youth to negotiate racial meanings and categories.\nIn Hip-hop Desis, Sharma investigates the nature of desi identification with blackness and in particular, how desi artists turn to hip-hop to negotiate with their racial status and create a sense of what it means to be desi. Sharma is particularly interested in the ways her respondents contend with accepted notions of race and the ways they articulate their own meanings of race. In doing so, desi artists revise the contours of both desiness and blackness as well as Americanness and hip-hop culture, exhibiting what she terms as a “global race consciousness” in which race constitutes “a matter of critical understanding—of ways of thinking about and being in the world rather than a reference to an individual’s biology or phenotype.”50\nDesi artists subscribe to the notion of hip-hop as an African American expressive form but nonetheless attempt to define their place within it. For some of Sharma’s interviewees, hip-hop does not necessarily and inevitably function as space to transcend difference, but rather a space to work through difference. According to Sharma, desi artists do not evade questions of race or difference but instead deal with these issues head-on. South Asians also look to hip-hop as a vehicle for the creation of identifications between South Asians and African Americans. Desi artists take an active part in the production of race that could then serve as a basis for cross-racial identifications. "},"document":{"title":"FILIPINOS REPRESENT","author":"Antonio T.
