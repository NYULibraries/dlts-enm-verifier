No fundamental change in Paterson’s views seems to have been necessary, only the kind of development shared by most of the Founders. He was, from his experience, a true Federalist, seeking national, sovereign power while retaining an important role for the states, which would remain “sovereign” in the exercise of their own nonnational powers.\nOne also senses about Paterson a certain underlying modesty and rectitude about his duties. On July 17, when he saw that the compromise would hold, his contribution to the convention was sufficient; it was time to return home to his family and his law practice. What Paterson had done was to furnish the strong but moderate opposition that the great plan of Madison required. If the Constitution were to be proposed and adopted, it was not only essential that the small states be protected; it was also critical that the convention itself be a means for argument, debate, and compromise. Paterson’s first argument on June 9 raised the question of representation. Then the New Jersey plan created the vehicle for the great debate. It is significant that Paterson was elected to the Committee of Compromise, and that Madison, Wilson, and Gouverneur Morris were not. One can only speculate about what might have happened to the convention if the small states had not been represented by a skillful, determined, and courageous advocate who was, at base, in agreement with Madison, Washington, and the other nationalists.\nThe Judiciary Act of 1789\nNew Jersey was the third state to ratify the Constitution.66 By August 1788, the required nine states had done so.67 On November 25,1788, William Paterson was chosen by a joint session of the legislature to be one of New Jersey’s two senators.68 He took his seat in the Senate on March 19, 1789, in New York City. On April 7, the Senate appointed a committee “to ‘bring in a bill for organizing the judiciary of the United States.’“69 Paterson was appointed to this committee, which produced the Judiciary Act of 1789.70\n"},"document":{"title":"Seriatim","author":"John Marshall","publisher":"New York University Press","id":51,"isbn":"9780814731437"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_238","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chapter8.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_238\">","css_selector":"#page_238","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_238\"]"},"next_location_id":13083,"previous_location_id":13081}]
