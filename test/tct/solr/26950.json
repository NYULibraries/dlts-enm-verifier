Any strategy that challenges established dogma will receive harsh criticism. But the fact that the African American community generally was not supportive of Ferguson is more problematic. This failure of support indicates a flaw in the defense. The black rage defense is supposed to educate and enlighten. It is a way of exposing racism and showing the terrible effects it has on the human psyche. If the facts of the crime and of the defendant’s life blind people to the message that racial oppression is a catalyst to crime, then the defense is counterproductive.\nDefending people who commit criminal acts is usually an unpopular undertaking. The strategy a lawyer employs in defending a person who has killed, whether it be James Johnson or Colin Ferguson, should not be determined by newspaper editorials or popularity polls. But the level of public support and the nature of criticism must be given serious consideration in deciding whether to use a black rage defense. In Johnson’s case there was strong, visible, organized support in the black community and in the auto plants. This support reflected people’s gut-level understanding of how racism had affected Johnson specifically. It also reflected the sophistication of the defense, which was able to open people’s minds to the effects of race and class oppression. When the defense, prosecution, judge, and jury walked through the Eldon plant and saw autoworkers visibly express their support of Johnson, it confirmed for them the truth of his black rage defense. In contrast, there was no such truth in Ferguson’s case.\nThere were two typical reactions to Ferguson’s crime. Many thought he was just a crazy person who went berserk. Others believed he had planned to kill white people as a way of dealing with his hate and his own failures. Neither reaction saw racism as a significant causal factor. Although there was a certain level of sympathy in the black community, it did not translate into support.\nFurther impediments were caused by the media frenzy around the case, which made it difficult to communicate a meaningful black rage defense. As bell hooks noted, “A complex understanding of black rage will not emerge with this case as spectacle, it is already being designed to invalidate the reality of black response to racism.” Most cases do not afford the opportunity to publicize the defense strategy.
