In the volume I coauthored with Steven Cohen, Two Worlds of Judaism,10 I argued that those American Jews who chose to retain their links to the tradition had reinterpreted it in accordance with values of individualism, voluntarism, universalism, and moralism. It was inevitable, Cohen and I asserted, that Jews would reinterpret the tradition, given the markedly different conditions under which American Jews lived in comparison with those under which the tradition emerged. In the concluding chapter of the book, therefore, we were not so concerned that the contemporary interpretation of Judaism in the United States constituted a radical departure from that tradition (although we made no secret of our unhappiness—mine in particular—on this point), but rather that it seemed to set American Judaism on a trajectory that was distancing it from Israeli interpretations of Judaism. I want to return to that point. I bent over backwards, perhaps at the prodding of my coauthor, in distinguishing my preferences from my analysis. In doing so, I conceded a survival capacity to American Judaism of the 1970s and 1980s that it may not merit. I can best explain what I think is likely to occur in the next few decades by elaborating upon my image of American Judaism at the present moment.\nJews relate to or accommodate themselves to or reappropriate the Jewish tradition in one of three ways. The tradition can constitute a kind of museum. Artifacts of the tradition are admired and enjoyed at one’s pleasure but without making demands upon one’s life. In that case, aspects of the tradition are culled out and relocated in a setting that facilitates a purely object-subject relationship.\nA second mode of relationship is best described by the term “submission.” According to this relationship the tradition is imagined as a series of commandments as well as customs to which the Jew is required to submit. That not all Jews who relate to the tradition submissively do in fact observe everything the tradition demands of them is immaterial, as long as they assume that submission is the appropriate norm and do not project deviations from this norm as legitimate. The relationship of “submission” raises "},"document":{"title":"The Americanization of the Jews","author":"Robert M.
