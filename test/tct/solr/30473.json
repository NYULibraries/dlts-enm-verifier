Shin left North Korea before the postproduction process was completed, and it is not clear whether it, like other projects such as Hong Kil-dong, was taken up subsequently.\n31  There seems to be a general consensus that the early “new tendency” writers such as Ch’oe Sŏ-hae staked out a political position that was closer to anarchism or vulgar communism than to theoretically informed Marxism. See Yi Chae-sŏn, The Korean Novel, and, recently in English, Kim Yoon-shik, “KAPF Literature in Modern Korean Literary History.” It should also be noted here that while Kang Kyŏng-ae was not formally connected to KAPF or to the earlier “new tendency” school, she is broadly considered a sort of fellow traveller of the socialist writers of the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n32  Yi Yŏn-ho, “Shin Sang-ok: Who Are You?,” 125.\n33  Though I might note that, in some rare instances, perhaps most strikingly in his 1963 Romance Gray (Romaensŭ kŭrei), Shin deployed zoom to incipiently modernist effect. The pseudodocumentary reportage of the film’s central affair is lent self-consciously comic and ironic effect by the use of extreme zoom shots to isolate faces and objects. This is markedly different from use of the zoom lens in the majority of Shin’s work, which serves, as it did for so many low-budget films throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially in Hong Kong, to collapse space and evoke movement without the logistic and economic burden of actual camera movement.\n34  For an illuminating elaboration of this distinction, see Suleiman, Authoritarian Fictions.\n35  See “Gender and Cinematic Adaptations of Ch’unhyangjŏn” in Hyangjin Lee, Contemporary Korean Cinema, 67–101; and Wang Sun-nyŏ, “A Comparison of North and South Korean Ch’unhyangjŏn.”\n36  The literal translation of Shin’s film, Sarang sarang nae sarang would be “Love, Love, My Love,” but it is rendered here as it was in the catalog for the 2001 Pusan retrospective, not only because that translation is more wieldy but also because it captures the expressiveness of the original film and song title.\n37  Lee, Contemporary Korean Cinema, 100.\n38  Wang Sun-nyŏ, “A Comparison of North and South Korean,” 167.\n39  Ibid., 88.\n40  The 1905 treaty, ratified under the coercion of an occupying force, granted Japanese authority over Korean foreign affairs and trade, officially signaling Korea’s "},"document":{"title":"Split Screen Korea","author":"Steven Chung","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","id":110,"isbn":"9781452941516"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":44813,"display_name":"Breakwater (film, Shin)"},"id":111880,"ring_next":30418,"ring_prev":30434},{"basket":{"id":44829,"display_name":"Ch'oe Sŏ-hae"},"id":111929,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":45005,"display_name":"Hong Kil-dong (film, Shin)"},"id":112585,"ring_next":30417,"ring_prev":30437},{"basket":{"id":45034,"display_name":"Japan -- colonial rule"},"id":112704,"ring_next":30248,"ring_prev":30406},{"basket":{"id":45038,"display_name":"Kang Kyŏng-ae"},"id":112719,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":45041,"display_name":"Korea Artista Proletaria Federatio (KAPF)"},"id":112807,"ring_next":30265,"ring_prev":30472},{"basket":{"id":45089,"display_name":"lenses -- zoom"},"id":112837,"ring_next":30331,"ring_prev":30424},{"basket":{"id":45114,"display_name":"modernism -- in filmmaking"},"id":112970,"ring_next":30246,"ring_prev":30401},{"basket":{"id":45222,"display_name":"Romance Gray (film, Shin)"},"id":113464,"ring_next":30346,"ring_prev":30346},{"basket":{"id":45228,"display_name":"Sarang sarang nae sarang (film, Shin)"},"id":113488,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":45302,"display_name":"tendency filmmaking"},"id":113773,"ring_next":30269,"ring_prev":30406}],"localid":"page_235","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/xhtml/notes.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"pg_235\"/>","css_selector":"#pg_235","xpath":"a[@id=\"pg_235\"]"},"next_location_id":30474,"previous_location_id":30472}]
