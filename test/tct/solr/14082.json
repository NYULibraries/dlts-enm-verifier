[{"id":14082,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"55-page_58","content_descriptor":"page 58","text":"forgive her? Dickens and Mrs. Gaskell are actually caught on the horns of a dilemma: is the breaking of God’s laws on sexuality forgiveable or not?\nThe intense guilt and shame that surround sexual misdemeanors, illegitimacy, and “fallen woman” in the Victorian novel surely has its origins in the intense importance people in the period came to attribute to religion. Religious issues were preeminent, as one can tell from George Eliot’s Scenes from Clerical Life and other novels, or the novels of Trollope or Mrs. Gaskell. In two novels, The Warden and l^prth and South, the protagonists make prodigious sacrifices, for themselves and their families, because of questions of religious conscience. In the journals of Victorian England religious issues are debated with passion and at enormous length. Religious questions could dismay and shatter the whole nation, as did questions over Bishop Colenso, Cardinal Newman and the Oxford Movement, and Darwinism.\nIn the eighteenth-century novel there are, of course, references to “principle,” and (as in Jane Austen) this involves Christian principles: in other works, like those of Defoe and Fielding, there is some deference to Christian commandments (such as those that guide sexual conduct or marriage), combined, often in a way of extraordinary duplicity (as in Roxana), with a realistic recognition of how human beings actually behave, and sometimes even with an admiring portrayal (again, as in Roxana) of how individuals manage to slide around their principles in pursuing their interests, or to adjust them with subtle expediency. In a novel like Pamela the most immoral sexual behavior becomes quite acceptable in the hero, once the woman has brought the man to the altar and made a good Christian marriage.\nIn the background of the Victorian novel we find a formidable adherence to Christian religion, whose precepts on sexuality exerted a powerful influence on people in all walks of life. And what seems dominant in people’s thinking about conduct, especially sexual conduct, is the Old Testament and the dire admonitions of St. Paul, such as his letter to the Corinthians:\nFlee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.    What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?    For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's. (1 Corinthians, 6)\n"},"document":{"title":"Charles Dickens and the Image of Woman","author":"David Holbrook","publisher":"New York University Press","id":55,"isbn":"9780814735282"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":7486,"display_name":"Austen, Jane"},"id":57280,"ring_next":14144,"ring_prev":14059},{"basket":{"id":21387,"display_name":"Sexuality -- Christianity and"},"id":57463,"ring_next":25049,"ring_prev":25054},{"basket":{"id":21390,"display_name":"Colenso, Bishop"},"id":57466,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21419,"display_name":"Darwinism"},"id":57520,"ring_next":24811,"ring_prev":27905},{"basket":{"id":7587,"display_name":"Defoe, Daniel"},"id":57560,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":7649,"display_name":"Eliot, George"},"id":57683,"ring_next":14083,"ring_prev":14074},{"basket":{"id":21580,"display_name":"Fielding, Henry"},"id":57842,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":7710,"display_name":"Gaskell, Mrs. Elizabeth"},"id":57881,"ring_next":14084,"ring_prev":14080},{"basket":{"id":21616,"display_name":"Guilt -- associated with sex"},"id":57922,"ring_next":14086,"ring_prev":14159},{"basket":{"id":21911,"display_name":"Newman, John Cardinal"},"id":58522,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21914,"display_name":"North and South (Gaskell)"},"id":58525,"ring_next":14085,"ring_prev":14085},{"basket":{"id":18688,"display_name":"Old Testament"},"id":58542,"ring_next":14083,"ring_prev":14080},{"basket":{"id":21940,"display_name":"Oxford Movement"},"id":58577,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21941,"display_name":"Pamela (Richardson)"},"id":58578,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21952,"display_name":"Paul, Saint"},"id":58596,"ring_next":14083,"ring_prev":14080},{"basket":{"id":21980,"display_name":"Principles"},"id":58652,"ring_next":14089,"ring_prev":14148},{"basket":{"id":22028,"display_name":"Religion -- in Victorian society"},"id":58738,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22049,"display_name":"Roxana (Defoe)"},"id":58794,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":26563,"display_name":"Eliot, George, writings -- Scenes of Clerical Life"},"id":58809,"ring_next":18102,"ring_prev":18107},{"basket":{"id":22105,"display_name":"Sexual misdemeanors, guilt, shame associated with"},"id":58879,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22121,"display_name":"Sexuality -- and religion"},"id":58903,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22128,"display_name":"Shame -- associated with sexual misdemeanors"},"id":58918,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22190,"display_name":"Trollope, Anthony"},"id":59050,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22220,"display_name":"Victorian novels -- religion and"},"id":59103,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22241,"display_name":"Warden, The (Trollope)"},"id":59137,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_58","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch02.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_58\">","css_selector":"#page_58","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_58\"]"},"next_location_id":14083,"previous_location_id":14081}]
