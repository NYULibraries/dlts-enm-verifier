Shortly after armed hostilities broke out in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb forces quickly suppressed armed resistance in most villages and cities. During and after the course of consolidating their gains, Bosnian Serb military and police personnel, and other agents of the Bosnian Serb administration, under the direction and control of RADOVAN KARADŽIĆ and RATKO MLADIĆ, systematically and wantonly appropriated and looted the real and personal property of Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians. The appropriation of property was extensive and not justified by military necessity. It occurred from April 1992 to January 1993 in the municipalities of Prijedor, Vlasenica, and Bosanski Samac, among others.\n28. The appropriation and looting of said property was accomplished in the following manner and by the following means, among others:\nA. Thousands of Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilians were forced into detention facilities where they remained for protracted periods of time. Upon entering these internment facilities, the personnel who ran the internment facilities systematically stole the personal property of the detainees, including jewelry, watches, money and other valuables. The detainees were rarely provided receipts for the property taken from them or given their property back upon their release.\nB. Civilians interned in these camps witnessed and/or were subjected to physical and psychological abuse. After witnessing or experiencing serious abuse, thousands of internees were forcibly transferred from these camps to locations inside and outside the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Before being forcibly transferred, many detainees were compelled to sign official Bosnian Serb documents wherein they “voluntarily” relinquished to the Bosnian Serb administration title to and possession of their real and personal property.\nC. In many instances, Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat civilian detainees were taken from internment camps to their homes and businesses and forced to turn over to their escorts money and other valuables. In other instances, they were used as labourers to load property from Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croat homes and businesses onto trucks for transportation to parts unknown. This occurred with the consent and approval of those in control of the detention facilities.\n"},"document":{"title":"This Time We Knew","author":"Thomas Cushman","publisher":"New York University Press","id":99,"isbn":"9780814715352"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_371","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/app3.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_371\">","css_selector":"#page_371","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_371\"]"},"next_location_id":28432,"previous_location_id":28430}]
