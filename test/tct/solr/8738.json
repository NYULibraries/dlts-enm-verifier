The Rig Veda reveals an underlying and apparently gender-based hostility that splits the pair; the Brabmana emphasizes the Gandharvas’ plot to reclaim the nymph who dared to prefer a mortal. That triangular relationships may objectify internal strife can be seen in the development of a theme in three seal maiden tales. In the first, the captured wife escapes her mortal husband, after which she plunges into the sea “where a male seal came up by her side—he had all the time been lying out there waiting for her.”1 A Shetland tale forges a stronger link between her discontent on land and the irresistible pull of the sea: the “lady would often steal alone to the desert strand, and, on a signal being given, a large seal would make his appearance, with whom she would hold, in an unknown tongue, an anxious conference.” Escape, however, does not fully resolve her dilemma and lingering conflict follows her to the otherworld: “before she dived to unknown depth, she cast a parting glance at the wretched Shetlander, whose despairing looks excited in her breast a few transient feelings of commiseration. ‘Farewell,’ said she to him: ‘I loved you very well when I resided upon earth, but I always loved my first husband much better.’”2\nThe third story dramatizes her conflict in a battle between her husband and the bull seal. Sensitive to his wife’s unhappiness, the man would take her to the sea, hoping she would derive solace from her natural element. On one such occasion he fights the seal, and after he staggers home weak with loss of blood, his wife confesses that although she left her seal mate for love of him, she often experiences an impulse to “return to her own kith and kin among the Seal-folk.” At such times the bull seal would seek her human spouse in order to kill him.3 Two "},"document":{"title":"In Search of the Swan Maiden","author":"Barbara Fass Leavy","publisher":"New York University Press","id":37,"isbn":"9780814751008"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":14396,"display_name":"Ibsen, Henrik, The Doll House"},"id":42222,"ring_next":8822,"ring_prev":8736},{"basket":{"id":14504,"display_name":"Rig Veda"},"id":42493,"ring_next":8807,"ring_prev":8707},{"basket":{"id":14518,"display_name":"Satapatha Brahmana"},"id":42522,"ring_next":8951,"ring_prev":8731}],"localid":"page_64","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch03.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_64\">","css_selector":"#page_64","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_64\"]"},"next_location_id":8739,"previous_location_id":8737}]
