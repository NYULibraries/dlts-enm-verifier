Before they could answer the question, they had to challenge the assumption that bisexuality exists by stating that it does not exist. In contrast, respondents who believe that bisexuality does exist could passively accept the question’s assumption and write an answer without giving a thought to the question of bisexual existence.\nMore than a third of the lesbian women who answered this question did exactly that (figure 4.1). They accepted the premise of the question that bisexuality exists and chose to discuss other issues relevant to bisexuality, referring to bisexuality as a real phenomenon. For example, Ruth commented that “this lifestyle could present problems,” and Chris stated “I admire them and welcome them into our community.” It is, therefore, reasonably safe to assume that these women, who comprised a plurality of the lesbians in the study, believe that bisexuality exists.\nGiven the ease with which lesbians who believe in bisexual existence could overlook the question of bisexual existence, however, it is surprising that nearly one out of five lesbians nevertheless stated explicitly that she believes that bisexuality exists (figure 4.1). Why would so many women have felt it necessary to state that which had already been assumed? Apparently, the question of bisexual existence is a salient one in lesbians’ minds and they did not feel that the assumption could be taken for granted. The women’s answers suggest that they were responding to an unspoken assertion that bisexuality does not exist, as if they had already read the answers of the women who do not believe that bisexuality exists and were responding to these answers instead of to the question that was written in the questionnaire. For example, Anne wrote, “I think many people are genuinely bisexual. I am often sad that the lesbian community can be so closed to bisexuality.”\nMany women described bisexuality as a valid, legitimate, or natural sexual orientation, or as one aspect of human sexual diversity. Comments by these women included “It is as valid a choice as any other,” “A legitimate option,” “It’s one kind of sexual preference,” “it is a state of being that some people exist in,” “It’s a valid orientation,” “It is as natural as any other sexual orientation,” and “It is one aspect of the wide spectrum of human sexual identity.” One terse respondent said simply, “It exists.”\nNot every woman who believes bisexuality exists feels positively about it. Some women believe it exists, but are either indifferent to bisexuals or dislike them:\nI feel it is a significant reality so I accept it. (Siana)\nSome people are this way. They are set on both sexes (not undecided). I prefer not to socialize with them. When they do I feel intruded upon.\n"},"document":{"title":"Bisexuality and the Challenge to Lesbian Politics","author":"Paula C.
