For Beijing in 2008, the “gap” between the Olympic media frenzy and ordinary coverage is unusually large. Although foreign audiences increasingly appreciate China's global importance, developments in China still receive disproportionately little international attention under ordinary circumstances. This is partly a matter of the inherent difficulties of covering a large; poor; rapidly changing; and physically, culturally, and linguistically remote country. It is also a function of political regime type. While China has undergone a breathtaking opening during the last generation, the PRC is still among a small handful of authoritarian states, and (with the exception of the Soviet Union in 1980) the most strongly authoritarian state since before World War II, to host an Olympics. Such regimes severely restrict information and journalists and do so in crude and obvious ways that are hard to sustain amid the global interest and expectations of openness that come with hosting the Games.\nAs Chinese authorities are acutely aware, an extraordinarily dense foreign press presence and relaxed media controls previously have had powerful political effects in China. Outside journalists who arrived to cover Soviet President Gorbachev's visit to Beijing helped catalyze, and bring international attention to, the Tiananmen Democracy Movement in 1989. In an exceptionally liberal period in Chinese politics and regime policy toward students, intellectuals, and the press, the Democracy Movement attracted an unusually large and unfettered media contingent—both foreign and indigenous—that reported extensively and dramatically on the movement and its violent suppression, with correspondingly greater harm to the Chinese leadership's international—and domestic—reputation.\nMany of the organizations and actors that seek to shape the story of the Beijing Games and, in turn, the PRC's behavior (and the media that cover them) also enjoy insulation from some of the more subtle pressures Chinese authorities ordinarily use to restrain those who are more durably on the ground in China. The NGOs, corporations, government officials, interest groups, celebrities, and others that are primarily focused on China for the Olympics differ from the foreign businesses, foreign-linked foundations and civil society organizations, and resident\n"},"document":{"title":"Owning the Olympics: Narratives of the New China","author":"Price, Monroe E.; Dayan, Daniel","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":9,"isbn":"9780472024506"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1859,"display_name":"Construction -- in Beijing"},"id":5260,"ring_next":1515,"ring_prev":1505},{"basket":{"id":23262,"display_name":"Soviet Union"},"id":6069,"ring_next":1560,"ring_prev":1486},{"basket":{"id":2073,"display_name":"Tiananmen Square -- and 1989"},"id":6127,"ring_next":1514,"ring_prev":1491}],"localid":"page_45","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/08_chap01.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_45\">","css_selector":"#page_45","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_45\"]"},"next_location_id":1511,"previous_location_id":1509}]
