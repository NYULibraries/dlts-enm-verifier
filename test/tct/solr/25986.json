Cultural radical feminists, for example, the members of Redstockings and The Feminists, were interested in the cultural transformation of society to eliminate sexism; they were, therefore, willing to critique the culture of heterosexism and welcomed lesbians as cultural workers (Marotta 1981). Much of what is now referred to as “women’s culture” is really lesbian culture; most so-called “women’s music” is composed by and for lesbians; “women’s coffeehouses” expect to attract a lesbian clientele; and most “women’s festivals” are attended primarily by lesbians. These institutions are no less than partial manifestations of the “Amazon Nation,” a visionary society that represents the culmination of both feminist and lesbian nationalism. The role of lesbians and lesbianism in “women’s culture” prompted Adam to refer to lesbianism in the 1970s as a form of “feminist ‘nationalism’” (Adam 1987:91).\nIn addition to feminist “women’s culture,” lesbians also created a history and ancestry that is uniquely lesbian. As Goodman et al. wrote, “Since mainstream society provides no context for lesbianism, we have created our own culture, and its birth has spanned many centuries. From Sappho and her colony on the isle of Lesbos in ancient Greece, through the witches in medieval Europe ... to the communal lesbian households of today, we have come together to share support, comfort, delight, despair, rituals, music, and magic” (1983:71). The romantic friends described by Faderman and the spinsters described by Carpenter are the ancestors of the modern lesbian, not the modern feminist; they are the ancestors of feminists only insofar as lesbianism is available to heterosexual feminists as a magical sign (King 1986).\nContemporary lesbian culture also reflects specifically lesbian needs and creativity, not general feminist concerns. For example, the high rate of alcoholism among lesbians has contributed to the development of a unique sensitivity to the needs of women in recovery, and the small size of the community produces ingrown “family trees” and rules for relating to ex-lovers that differ dramatically from the norms governing heterosexual ex-relationships. Concerns about cultural sensitivity have generated a complex form of political correctness that predated the distorted image of political correctness produced in the late 1980s by the religious and political right for its own ends. The mark of a mature culture might be the ability to make fun of itself; contemporary lesbian culture is "},"document":{"title":"Bisexuality and the Challenge to Lesbian Politics","author":"Paula C.
