It might even be supported by certain strategic quotes from Lacan. In Book II Lacan insists that the subject is not an “entity,” and later that the “subject is no one.”17 But these quotations, like many others, need to be read in terms of the context and contradictions within Lacan’s thought, and not in terms of their agreement with existing poststructuralist ideas. Lacan is not saying that there is no subject; he is instead disputing the kinds of boundaries placed on the subject by traditional psychoanalytic theory. Lacan is disputing traditional interpretations of Freud, but he is not defining himself as a poststructuralist.\nMacdonell’s rejection of the self is a good example of Burke’s logic of reduction: the tendency of any particular theory to purify its own language at the expense of good sense. Once something gets seen in terms of something else, Burke points out, it soon can be reduced to something that is “nothing but” that which it is seen in terms of. Because the characteristic gesture of structuralism is to see the subject in terms of language, the subject easily becomes nothing but language. These attempts to read Lacan’s “subject of discourse” as a “nothing” that fades back into discourse, however, misread Lacan. Such an absolute dismissal of the subject is ill-considered—even for poststructuralist theory. It represents little more than an attempt to simplify discourse theory by banishing difficult concepts.\nLacan’s theory of the subject offers a solution to the impasse attending the debates between Freudians and poststructuralists. For Lacan, relations between discourse and the subject are two-sided. The subject operates on discourse, and discourse operates the subject. This dialogical interaction between subject-functions shaping discourse, and social forces providing the matrix of discourse, is useful for understanding the particular nature of speech products. This model suggests, first, that there are specific subject-functions (repression, for example) that can always deflect and give idiosyncratic shape to social discourse. This is true because self-components within the self interact to produce particular and unique discourse effects. Second, Lacan forces us to recognize that we must study many different and distinct discourse functions (ideology, knowledge, narcissism, repetition) that operate on the subject as the subject interacts in a discourse community. It is a great oversimplification to represent these discourse functions in general terms—in terms either of general “subject-positions” plotted by social discourse, or in terms of some autonomous ego that defines itself through discourse.\n"},"document":{"title":"Narcissism and the Literary Libido","author":"Marshall W.
