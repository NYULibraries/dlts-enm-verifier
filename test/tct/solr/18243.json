For legal details, she consulted the lawyer Frederic Harrison, as she had done while she was writing Felix Holt(476). She made her first \"Sketches towards Daniel Deronda” in early 1874; the writing was completed by June 1876. Daniel Deronda was published in eight parts during February-September of 1876. Throughout the writing of the novel, Eliot had characteristically experienced recurring depressions and ill health. At the same time, Lewes, in a more positive frame of mind, was working energetically on his Problems of Life and Mind, volume 2 of which was published early in 1875.\nBlackwood’s response to Daniel Deronda was enthusiastic from the outset, and continued to be so as he received each part of the manuscript (Letters 6:143, 144, 182, 221, 227, 239, 261, 262, 271, 295, 305). Among many other positive comments, he observed a new technique in Eliot’s fiction writing that reflects her gift for psychological analysis; of her characterization of Gwendolen he wrote, \"[Gwendolen's] running mental reflections after each few words she has said to Grandcourt are like what passes through the mind after each move at a game, and as far as I know a new device in reporting a conversation\" (182). Upon receiving the last section of the book, he wrote Lewes: \"Grand, glorious, and touching are too mild words for this last book. In fact criticism and eulogism are out of place. I feel more than ever what I have often said to critics: 'Bow and accept with gratitude whatever George Eliot writes'\" (262). The successful sales of the book suggest that most readers agreed with him. As Haight notes, \"The publication of this last of her novels marked the zenith of George Eliot’s fame. She was regarded as the greatest living English novelist\" (Biography 491).\nBlackwood had also written at one point that he was \"puzzling and thinking over [the Mordecai] phase of the Tale\" (Letters 6:222). Indeed, some of Eliot’s contemporaries were not only puzzled by but critical of what Barbara Hardy calls the \"conspicuously ideological and symbolic\" presentation of \"the Jewish problem\" (\"Introduction\" 10). Eliot was gratified, however, by letters from many prominent Jews, who appreciated the extent of her knowledge of Judaism and her positive portrayal of Jewish people. Among them were Dr. Hermann Adler, Rabbi of the Bayswater Synagogue; Haim Guedalla, one of the leaders of the Jewish community in London; Abram Samuel Isaacs, an American Jew at the Theological Seminary in Breslau; and Abraham Benisch, editor of the "},"document":{"title":"The Transformation of Rage","author":"Peggy Fitzhugh Johnstone","publisher":"New York University Press","id":68,"isbn":"9780814742358"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":26479,"display_name":"Blackwood, John (editor and publisher) -- and Deronda"},"id":69014,"ring_next":18261,"ring_prev":18242},{"basket":{"id":26515,"display_name":"Eliot, George, depression -- Bede, Deronda, Felix, Marner"},"id":69141,"ring_next":18261,"ring_prev":18201},{"basket":{"id":26579,"display_name":"Eliot, George, writings -- Felix Holt"},"id":69401,"ring_next":18270,"ring_prev":18215},{"basket":{"id":26639,"display_name":"Lewes, George Henry -- Problems of Life and Mind"},"id":69580,"ring_next":18264,"ring_prev":18237}],"localid":"page_160","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch07.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_160\">","css_selector":"#page_160","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_160\"]"},"next_location_id":18244,"previous_location_id":18242}]
