The acculturated Jew was by then a full-fledged American; when he and his New England wife moved to L.A., fastest-growing city of the United States, he was likely to feel at least as much at home there as she did. The native New Englander, comfortably married to a Jewish husband, is ready to follow wherever he goes. Disturbing the gorgeous peace are only those haunted Jews who carry the mark—and who become the reminder—of sinister evil. By blessed American standards the Hontis and Oleam are “unbalanced”; their excessive history is inappropriate to the brilliant California sunshine. They realize that their attraction to America can never be reciprocated because to the same degree that they hope to be healed by American innocence, that innocence is in terror of being destroyed by them.

To his left were the harbors, the beaches, the glinting Pacific Ocean. To the right lay the floor of the San Fernando Valley, and beyond that, the sullen ranges of the San Gabriels.\nDaniel Fuchs does not flinch from exposing the comedy as well as the sorrow of this Zarathustra of suffering (who could have been played by Zero Mostel). Yet the story also awakens more respect and affection for Honti than he has for himself. This European novelty manufacturer, whose heart and intelligence were forcibly expanded during the war beyond what his fellow Americans ever had to feel or learn, appears to Fuchs as the reluctant prophet of the "},"document":{"title":"The Americanization of the Jews","author":"Robert M.
