Clara takes issue with the Prince's conception of politics, but assures him, “I love my husband,” which the prince deems “a good answer” (204).\nThe novel opens in the same key as it ends: upholding the natural, inherent worth of Englishness by referencing the “innocent women and children” threatened by Irish dynamite. Its dedication is to Constable William Cole and Sergeant Thomas Cox, two police officers who were injured while disposing of dynamite planted in the January 1885 bombing: “Whoever be in the right in this great and confused war of politics … your side, your part, is at least pure of doubt. Yours is the side of the child, of the breeding woman” (vi). The “child” and “breeding woman” function here as in the prince's speech: whatever England's political dealings, its domestic nucleus proves its decency. Past critics of the novel have viewed the dedication as disingenuous, but Stevenson's letters uphold its point of view, and contemporaries saw it as sincere.40 It is not surprising that critics have seen The Dynamiter's dedication as insincere, since it is so at odds with the rest of the book. At one point in the novel, Zero expresses comic outrage at the implication that one of his bombings was a “fiasco”: “‘You will pardon me again,’ returned Zero with positive asperity; ‘a child was injured’” (186). That the Stevensons could joke about the dynamiting of children and still have a blockbuster on their hands indicates that their use of gender ideology in the novel's frame to diffuse its volatility was an incredibly powerful symbolic deployment.41 In this context, The Dynamiter's dedication and conclusion serve to recast the sides of political conflict the Stevensons depict: the essential conflict at the heart of modern political crime, we are to believe, is not between bourgeoisie and proletariat, the represented and the disenfranchised, men and women, or, in the case of the Irish question, colonizers and colonized.42 Instead, it is between home and the streets, babies and bombs. This accords with a broader cultural tendency, evident in this novel, to depict radicalism as anathema to the bonds of the nuclear family. In The Dynamiter, the supposedly self-evident value of normative domesticity effectively shuts down political debate.\nDespite this ending, the vast bulk of The Dynamiter, like Vera and A Girl among the Anarchists, employs the female revolutionary as an attractive representation of modern challenges to established authorities; she unites democracy, first-wave feminism, and political terror as modern challenges to the configuration of national and public representation. Perhaps it was not finally in the best interest of feminism to have the New Woman coupled with dynamite, nor, certainly, with an overweening\n"},"document":{"title":"Framed: The New Woman Criminal in British Culture at the Fin de Siecle","author":"Elizabeth Carolyn Miller","publisher":"University of Michigan Press and University of Michigan Library","id":29,"isbn":"9780472024469"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":7548,"display_name":"class"},"id":24303,"ring_next":6199,"ring_prev":6179},{"basket":{"id":7591,"display_name":"democracy / democratization"},"id":24581,"ring_next":6196,"ring_prev":6192},{"basket":{"id":7672,"display_name":"feminism"},"id":24990,"ring_next":6199,"ring_prev":6190},{"basket":{"id":1257,"display_name":"imperialism"},"id":25347,"ring_next":6205,"ring_prev":6188},{"basket":{"id":7687,"display_name":"Ireland -- Irish nationalism"},"id":25390,"ring_next":6221,"ring_prev":6188},{"basket":{"id":7759,"display_name":"Ireland -- \"Irish question\""},"id":25396,"ring_next":6130,"ring_prev":6188},{"basket":{"id":7673,"display_name":"New Woman, The"},"id":25829,"ring_next":6202,"ring_prev":6190},{"basket":{"id":7894,"display_name":"political crime"},"id":25998,"ring_next":6216,"ring_prev":6190},{"basket":{"id":7924,"display_name":"Rossetti, Helen -- A Girl among the Anarchists"},"id":26165,"ring_next":6198,"ring_prev":6192},{"basket":{"id":7925,"display_name":"Rossetti, Olivia -- A Girl among the Anarchists"},"id":26197,"ring_next":6198,"ring_prev":6192},{"basket":{"id":8012,"display_name":"Wilde, Oscar -- Or, the Nihilists (drama)"},"id":26747,"ring_next":6198,"ring_prev":6190}],"localid":"page_220","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/15_chap05.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_220\">","css_selector":"#page_220","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_220\"]"},"next_location_id":6195,"previous_location_id":6193}]
