Sari in 2009 is PCAP's coordinator of membership and special projects.\n16. The amount for the mentee rose to $500 in 2007.\n17. In the January 2004 meeting, mentees defined the role of mentor: listening, alert, interested, active, honest, understanding, empathetic, and caring. They asked for linkage improvements: clear expectations at the outset, assistance navigating the local art world, more opportunities for exhibitions and readings, forthright, honest communication with the mentor, personal boundary setting by the mentor, and quarterly informal area meetings. From PCAP they asked for more regular communication, a linkage website and e-mail chat room (although so few mentees had Internet access), and for assistance finding updated transitional services. It was a lot and asked a lot, but the meeting was rich, energetic, and forward-looking. The outside experts were very encouraging, and Linkage and Portfolio were stimulated.\n18. James Ben, Lessie Brown, Mary Heinen, Jerry Moore, Tracy Neal, Lionel Stewart, and India Sullivan. Anthony James, one of our first two former artists on the Advisory Board (Tracy was the other), was never a mentee.\n19. In 2005, Leo Lalonde, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections, said “we needed to get out of Western Wayne because it was on a landfll” (Joseph Kirschke, “Hard Time; Hundreds of Complaints Filed by Huron Valley's Women Prisoners,” Detroit Metro Times, March 3, 2005). A 1994 Rouge River Remedial Action Plan Update rated the Western Wayne site at 33 out of a possible 48 (the highest) on its clean-up priority list and noted that “the cleanup plan was not approved by the MDNR and interim response activity has been, or is being, provided by state funds.” http://www.epa.gov/grtlakes/aoc/rougeriv/1994_Rouge-River-RAP-Update.pdf. Some of what I report is word-of-mouth from prisoners at Western Wayne.\n20. E-mail message, December 9, 2007. It shouldn't pass notice that not only were men and women incarcerated in these prisons (men at Western Wayne until 2000), but that other men and women came there to work forty hours a week and more.\n21. According to a September 2006 Justice Department report, “56 percent of jail inmates in state prisons and 64 percent of inmates across the country reported mental health problems within the past year” (Bernard E. Harcourt,” “The Mentally Ill, Behind Bars,” New York Times, January 15, 2007, A19). Since returning citizens need to hold jobs, reintegrate with families, control tendencies to addiction and previous patterns of behavior, this is the most challenging and primary issue to address, according to Mary King, of the Washtenaw County Michigan Prisoner Re-entry Initiative.\n22.
