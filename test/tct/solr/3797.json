Rather, realness requires an unsentimental perspective on contemporary life that recognizes how the mere repetition of a text, sound, or image illustrates the ongoing production of discursive communities based on race, gender, and sexuality. As the epigraph to this section notes, Neal has identified cultural critique and deconstruction of stereotypes (both positive and negative ones) as central goals of contemporary African American cultural production. Central to articulating these criticisms, hip-hop aesthetics deploys irony to insist on the continuing importance of race in shaping discursive communities, social experiences, and legal doctrines.\nBoth the music of Dead Prez and the comedy of Dave Chappelle illustrate how irony operates by exploring existing social cleavages. Dead Prez is a hip-hop group whose name simultaneously references both money, because U.S. currency tends to celebrate past political leaders, and a revolutionary politics, which would lead to the metaphorical deaths of our current leaders.71 Dead Prez is unusually political by hip-hop standards. Its conscious deployment of irony is designed to remind the hip-hop nation of its putative political commitments and assert that community's cultural, political, and racial difference from the mainstream.72 The group's race-conscious politics have caused them tremendous difficulty in securing a recording contract. On the other hand, Dave Chappelle has found commercial and popular success with his ironic commentaries about the myth of a colorblind America. In one skit, Chappelle imagines how the country would respond to George W. Bush's public persona and his policies if he were black.73 Through his ironic portrayal of President Bush, Chappelle demonstrates how race still shapes public opinion, the political order, and perhaps most importantly the country's sense of humor. Both Dead Prez and Chappelle examine the illusion of authenticity demanded by hip-hop. Dead Prez reveals the “false consciousness” of hip-hop stars who create radical street personas but willingly trade that persona for material success, which disconnects them from their community. Chappelle deconstructs racial stereotypes and taboo topics in a putatively color-blind society. Even as he questions the logic of authenticity, Chappelle relies on his racial identity to save his own racialized representations from being viewed as racist depictions.74 Unlike Dead Prez, whose antiracist and anticapitalist politics are pretty clearly presented, Chappelle has politics that are harder to discern.\nPerhaps no song more than N.W.A.’s “Fuck tha Police” better represents the irony implicit within hip-hop lyrics.
