On this occasion Ellison said of Invisible Man that, in order for the novel to fully capture America for its “rich diversity” and “magical fluidity and freedom,” he had been forced “to conceive of a novel unburdened by the narrow naturalism which has led, after so many triumphs, to the final and unrelieved despair which marks so much of our current fiction.”124\nIn “Black Boys,” Howe argued that Invisible Man was a “brilliant but flawed achievement,” which stood with Native Son as the major works composed by Black Americans, and the one novel that came closest to a nonprotest novel. The story of the journey from South to North of the young Black boy, from childhood humiliations at the hands of whites, to a Southern Black college, from job to job in the North, and finally into the hands of the Harlem Communists, avoided “for long stretches” the formula of protest that Baldwin had eloquently described, yet was not so perfectly free from the “ideological and emotional penalties” suffered by Black Americans in the United States. The brilliance of the novel was Ellison’s “rich and wild inventiveness” and his ability to capture the “hidden gloom and surface gaiety of Negro life.” But Ellison could not avoid getting caught up in the “idea of the Negro.” What irked Howe most was the hero’s assertion at the end of the novel, as he “finds himself in some unspecified way, that “my world has become one of infinite possibilities.” Howe called this technique of proclaiming self-liberation a favorite strategy of the 1950s but a strategy that “violates the realities of social life, the interplay between external conditions and personal will.” It was impossible, Howe felt, to define one’s individuality without dealing with social barriers that stood in the way. “Freedom can be fought for, but it cannot always be willed or asserted into existence. And it seems hardly an accident that even as Ellison’s hero asserts the ‘infinite possibilities’ he makes no attempt to specify them.”125\nHowe’s contention that Baldwin and Ellison masqueraded as “Native Sons” to hide the fact that they were “Black Boys” evoked a reply of "},"document":{"title":"Blacks in the Jewish Mind","author":"Seth Forman","publisher":"New York University Press","id":83,"isbn":"9780814726815"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":33999,"display_name":"Ellison, Ralph -- and Irving Howe"},"id":85287,"ring_next":22845,"ring_prev":22845},{"basket":{"id":5782,"display_name":"Ellison, Ralph: The Invisible Man"},"id":85497,"ring_next":24214,"ring_prev":22740}],"localid":"page_124","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch03.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_124\">","css_selector":"#page_124","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_124\"]"},"next_location_id":22743,"previous_location_id":22741}]
