In the final story of the series, a woman named Julia Bensasan admits, “I poisoned my husband … I hated that feeble man. I poisoned him with arsenic” (“Teeth” 290). “The Blood-Red Cross” features a nurse named Rebecca Curt, recently escaped from prison after committing “forgery, with a strong and very daring attempt at poisoning” (512). This character reflects a contemporary fascination with the nurse poisoner: Nordau's 1895 best seller Degeneration, for example, recounts the 1884 case of a Swiss nurse—Marie Jeanneret—who fatally poisoned nine victims out of sadistic impulses (277–78). Unquestionably, Meade exploits sensationalist preoccupation with such cases, but her three female poisoners also function to destabilize essential femininity: Rebecca Curt is a nurse, Sara poisons Piozzi's milk, and Julia Bensasan poisons her husband presumably via food or drink. All these crimes mimic conventional feminine caregiving. Meade's depiction of female chemical villainy thus transforms age-old stereotypes of female witchery into modern New Woman Criminals, whose powers lie in scientific expertise rather than the eye of newt.\nSara's expertise is quite apparent to detective Druce when he visits her beauty shop. He finds a site resembling Frankenstein's workshop or Dr. Jekyll's laboratory rather than the collection of rouge-pots and perfumes he expects of a “professional beautifier”:\nThere stood a … table, on which lay an array of extraordinary-looking articles and implements—stoppered bottles full of strange medicaments, mirrors … brushes, sprays, sponges, delicate needle-pointed instruments of bright steel, tiny lancets, and forceps. Facing this table was a chair, like those used by dentists…. Another chair, supported on a glass pedestal, was kept there, Madame Sara informed me, for administering static electricity. There were dry-cell batteries for the continuous currents and induction coils for Faradic currents…. Madame took me from this room into another, where a still more formidable array of instruments were to be found. Here were a wooden operating table and chloroform and ether apparatus. (“Madame” 392)\nThe back room of Sara's shop, with its operating table and anesthetics, may have reminded readers of rumors that Madame Rachel was an abortionist. Indeed, the specter of this prospect hangs about the stories: “[Sara's] clients go to her there, and she does what is necessary for them. It is a fact that she occasionally performs small surgical operations” (“Madame” 388). Such insinuations represent Sara as a challenge to nineteenth-century\n"},"document":{"title":"Framed: The New Woman Criminal in British Culture at the Fin de Siecle","author":"Elizabeth Carolyn Miller","publisher":"University of Michigan Press and University of Michigan Library","id":29,"isbn":"9780472024469"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":7455,"display_name":"abortion"},"id":23989,"ring_next":6073,"ring_prev":6051},{"basket":{"id":7483,"display_name":"assassination"},"id":24106,"ring_next":6123,"ring_prev":6024},{"basket":{"id":7568,"display_name":"cosmetics"},"id":24466,"ring_next":6074,"ring_prev":6063},{"basket":{"id":7608,"display_name":"domestic sphere"},"id":24665,"ring_next":6087,"ring_prev":6069},{"basket":{"id":7761,"display_name":"James, Henry -- The Princess Casamassima"},"id":25436,"ring_next":6123,"ring_prev":6059},{"basket":{"id":7780,"display_name":"Madame Rachel"},"id":25578,"ring_next":6074,"ring_prev":6070},{"basket":{"id":7822,"display_name":"Meade, L.
