Worry about emotional “contagion” limited tolerance for the angry, the grief-stricken, the depressed. This trend helped generate new needs (though again more widely among women than among men) for professionals whose job it was to listen to intense emotions that might find no other audience. The rise of therapy in the American middle class, though deriving from a number of factors, including the decline of fervent religion, owed much to the need to find listeners as the more traditional pool dried up.39\nDeclining tolerance for emotional intensity in others had other effects that marked its fairly steady progress between the 1920s and the 1980s. Two developments in particular delineated the changes in the audience for emotion. The first marks a growing need to identify real emotional sharing as a special rather than a normal trait. The second suggests ways in which some individuals tried to develop alternatives to serious support from the outside world.\nThe word “empathy” was coined early in the twentieth century, in part to provide an English equivalent for the German word Einfühlung. The word initially gained currency only among experts in psychology and kindred fields and was not directed toward normal social interactions. By the 1920s it was particularly applied to the capacity for deep appreciation of works of art or music. The word gained public usage only in the 1950s and 1960s in the United States, where it described individuals able to share deeply in the feelings of others. By the 1980s it was dubbed a “vogue word,” open to some confusions but most commonly denoting a capacity for emotional sharing.40 The coining, progress, and changing emphases of the word suggest that an emotionally altruistic quality needed to be identified because it stood out from what were becoming the most common reactions to the feelings of others. Empathy involved more than a negotiated willingness to listen briefly to the emotions of others in the expectation that the same service would be provided in return—the most common ventilationist strategy. The quality was praised, but more significantly it was reified and granted terminology because of its scarcity value. Finding an empathic listener when in emotional need or even a truly empathic moment on the part of a reasonably sensitive other became an achievement clearly to be distinguished from normal experience. Finding an explicit term for such an unusual experience became equally necessary.\n"},"document":{"title":"American Cool","author":"Peter N.
