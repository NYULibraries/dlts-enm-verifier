This part of Huyssen’s analysis indicates a direction in which interpretations of Rilke’s fiction should be developing. At the end of my review of recent Rilke criticism I shall say more about this approach, in my reflections on Brigitte Bradley’s study of The Notebooks.\nA number of recent commentators on Rilke’s work continue to divorce the poetry from the poet’s life, as if any attempt to read the Duino Elegies, The Sonnets to Orpheus, and other great poems by Rilke with understanding enhanced by consideration of his life and by psychoanalytic insights demeans the poetry and deprives it of proper aesthetic appreciation. Some critics, Huyssen argues, see Rilke as representing “a modernism of disembodied subjectivity, metaphysical negativity, and textual closure, the classicism of the twentieth century.”2 Such criticism may develop perceptive readings of individual poems and passages, but it often suppresses much of the emotional and intellectual complexity, vitality, richness, and subtlety of Rilke’s work.\nOne of the strongest statements of antipathy to psychoanalytic and biographical criticism among Rilke scholars is to be found in the foreword to Jacob Steiner’s book Rilkes Duineser Elegien (1962 and 1969). Steiner goes to the extreme of insisting that the more boldly the biographical “I” of the poet stands out in the “i” of the work, so much the worse is the poetry (“Aber es lásst sich vermuten, dass das biographische Ich des Dichters umso starker durch das ich des Werks hervortritt, je schlechter die Dichtung ist”).3 Attacking Simenauer’s analysis, Steiner says he forgets that “the private person Rilke is not yet the poet in his productive hours and that ... from the productive poet to his product there is a distance to be overcome whose breadth, unfathomable depth, and complexity have not been measured up to the present time” (“Aber er vergisst dabei, dass die private Person Rilke noch nicht der Dichter in seinen producktiven Stunden ist und dass auch vom producktiven Dichter zu seinen Produkt ein Abstand zu überwinden ist, dessen Weite, Abgründigkeit und Komplexität bisher nicht ermessen worden sind”).4\nThis doctrine foreshadows more sophisticated and carefully argued attempts to define and justify the critical concept of “das lyrische Ich” (the lyric I) in each poem, such as Kate Hamburger’s in Die Logik der "},"document":{"title":"The Beginning of Terror","author":"David Kleinbard","publisher":"New York University Press","id":44,"isbn":"9780814746677"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":16257,"display_name":"Art -- modernists and post-modernists"},"id":45521,"ring_next":10788,"ring_prev":10788},{"basket":{"id":6078,"display_name":"Baudelaire, Charles"},"id":45544,"ring_next":10758,"ring_prev":8107},{"basket":{"id":2130,"display_name":"Benjamin, Walter"},"id":45554,"ring_next":19108,"ring_prev":6214},{"basket":{"id":16300,"display_name":"Bradley, Brigitte L."},"id":45583,"ring_next":10761,"ring_prev":10761},{"basket":{"id":16398,"display_name":"Hamburger, Käte"},"id":45823,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":16482,"display_name":"\"Lyric I, the\""},"id":46045,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":16659,"display_name":"Rilke's writings -- Duino Elegies (Duineser Elegien)"},"id":46465,"ring_next":10758,"ring_prev":10751},{"basket":{"id":28124,"display_name":"Rilke's writings -- Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge, The (Die Aufzeichnungnen des Malte Laurids Brigge)"},"id":46547,"ring_next":10760,"ring_prev":10751},{"basket":{"id":16599,"display_name":"Simenauer, Erich"},"id":46896,"ring_next":10758,"ring_prev":10752},{"basket":{"id":6299,"display_name":"Simmel, Georg"},"id":46903,"ring_next":18731,"ring_prev":4706},{"basket":{"id":16807,"display_name":"Steiner, Jacob"},"id":46934,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_13","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch01.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_13\">","css_selector":"#page_13","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_13\"]"},"next_location_id":10756,"previous_location_id":10754}]
