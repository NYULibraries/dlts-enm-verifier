Steele’s vision of a bloodless ethnic cleansing proved, in the end, too much even for Tough Stephen Carter. Carter’s Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby included “a dissenting view about dissenting views” specifically to distance himself from Steele. Carter embraced “racial solidarity” as an opportunity rather than a curse: “It does not strike me as either plausible or desirable for intellectuals to say, in effect, ‘We put behind us all that we are. We have no interest in our backgrounds, in our communities and cultures that gave us birth.’ Besides, to put the matter bluntly, our people need us.”4\nAgain, Steele wishes to free African American individuals from what he tendentiously calls “the tyranny of wartime collectivism in which they must think of themselves as victims in order to identify with their race.” Yet Tough Love lawyer Randall Kennedy apparently rejects Steele’s assumption that group identity is always victimology. Kennedy characterizes society’s major problems as collective difficulties and appropriates Steele’s militaristic vocabulary for benign ends. Kennedy urges that poverty “just like war constitutes a collective challenge.”5\nFor Stephen Dedalus and Shelby Steele, by contrast, the culture necessarily tyrannizes the intellectual. The young Dedalus proclaims, “My art will proceed from a free and noble source. It is too troublesome for me to adopt the manners of these slaves. I refuse to be terrorized into stupidity.” Steele echoes, “Each race has its politics and its party line that impose a certain totalitarianism over the maverick thoughts of individuals.” Whereas Joyce’s authorial voice ironically and sympathetically undermines Stephen Dedalus’s pretensions, Shelby Steele’s view appears entirely in earnest. “Every jackass going the roads thinks he has ideas,” comments young Dedalus’s activist school friend in Joyce’s book. Further discussion of Shelby Steele’s cultural vision would be uninteresting and, at least since James Joyce, superfluous.\nWhat remains interesting is the quiet audacity of Steele’s project. When Steele’s book offers the content of our character, we should not underestimate his descriptive ambitions. Steele presents his vision as fact, not a jackass idea. Steele assures us that while ideas generally come a dime a dozen, he has discovered the right fit of ideas and reality. How? Steele credits his wife’s “specialized knowledge” as a clinical psychologist. With his wife’s science, Steele is able to distinguish mere “hyperbolic correlatives” of oppression "},"document":{"title":"Clarence Thomas and the Tough Love Crowd","author":"Ronald Suresh Roberts","publisher":"New York University Press","id":94,"isbn":"9780814774816"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":39451,"display_name":"Dissent -- Stephen Carter"},"id":97875,"ring_next":26560,"ring_prev":26560},{"basket":{"id":39455,"display_name":"Dissent -- Shelby Steele"},"id":97885,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":39479,"display_name":"Expertise, exaggerated claims of"},"id":97920,"ring_next":26585,"ring_prev":26565},{"basket":{"id":39487,"display_name":"Gates, Henry Louis, Jr. -- and Shelby Steele"},"id":97950,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":39511,"display_name":"Individualism versus communitarianism"},"id":98004,"ring_next":26599,"ring_prev":26577},{"basket":{"id":12263,"display_name":"Joyce, James"},"id":98019,"ring_next":26597,"ring_prev":26582},{"basket":{"id":39646,"display_name":"Psychology -- and Shelby Steele"},"id":98260,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":39696,"display_name":"Science -- pseudoscience"},"id":98344,"ring_next":26588,"ring_prev":26567},{"basket":{"id":39714,"display_name":"Steele, Shelby -- claims of objectivity"},"id":98397,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":39716,"display_name":"Steele, Shelby -- and ideal of racelessness"},"id":98399,"ring_next":26597,"ring_prev":26597},{"basket":{"id":39537,"display_name":"Kennedy, Randall -- and Shelby Steele"},"id":98402,"ring_next":26590,"ring_prev":26582}],"localid":"page_30","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch03.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_30\">","css_selector":"#page_30","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_30\"]"},"next_location_id":26584,"previous_location_id":26582}]
