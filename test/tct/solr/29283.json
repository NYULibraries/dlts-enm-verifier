Indeed, Fanon, who we have read was an important influence on the party, drew on the organized self-defense among Black people in the U.S. South to theorize colonialism and racism.47 He argued that unlike moments when consent is the dominant form of rule (hegemony in Gramsci’s sense), in colonial or racist relationships, force is the rule and consent the exception.48\nAs critical race scholar Nikhil Singh argues, because “Williams, Malcolm X, and the Panthers all recognized  …  that the relationship between violence and racism was inextricable,” they also understood that this violence “needed to be met with a credible response.”49 Carmichael’s 1968 speech in Watts indicated as much. Singh continues: “By advocating organized counter-violence by Black people in the U.S., they suggested that the American state, as the holder of a monopoly on the legitimate uses of violence, was either inadequate to, or complicit in the perpetuation of forms of racist violence that continued to be exercised over Black bodies. What this amounted to was a de facto repudiation of the state as the entity safeguarding a sphere of public civility and order. The call for violence, in other words, was a powerful assertion of the necessary autonomy of Black life in the United States.”50\nThe split between the Newton and Cleaver, which caused a major rift in the party in 1971, largely concerned the place of violence within revolutionary strategy. Existing tensions in the party were exacerbated by government counterintelligence operations, but internal conflicts revolved around difficult issues of violence within the party, accountability, and the lack of internal democracy.51 As police repression left so many members of the party dead or imprisoned, Newton emphasized the importance of mass mobilization and survival programs “so that they can survive through this oppression. Then when they are ready to pick up the gun, serious business will happen.”52 For Cleaver, however, such programs represented the party’s “right-wing bureaucratic apparatus,” which was at odds with what he called the party’s underground left wing. He feared that inability to resolve the conflict would “eliminate an organization that is not able to adapt itself to new conditions of struggle.”53 The possible directions seemed to be movement building versus underground vanguardism.\nThe 1971 House Committee on Internal Security claimed that the Black Panthers’ serve-the-people programs represented a “swing away from "},"document":{"title":"Health Rights Are Civil Rights","author":"Jenna M.
