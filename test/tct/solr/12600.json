If, then, Deconstruction is in America, that means also, in the second place, that it is not America. If D is in A, it is not A; if D is A, it is not in, etc. The slash indeed inscribes or incises a disjunction in the copula “is,” in the coupling of the present that interests me here. How can the is itself be disjoined from itself, out of joint?\nWhen Hamlet says “The time is out of joint,” he says, to be sure, many things (we will come back to that); but he says at least and first of all this, by folding the proposition back on itself in advance: that time itself, the present indicative of the verb to be in the third person singular, the “is” that says what time is, this tense of time is out of joint, itself and by itself out of joint. And the shock waves of such a disjoining doubtless affect the heart of the question “to be or not to be.” The essence of Being is often determined, in a non-fortuitous fashion, as Heidegger often insists, on the basis of the third person singular of the present indicative, so that what happens to “is” happens to the bar that separates to be and/or not to be. There would no longer even be a question without this disjoinng of the “is.”\nPerhaps deconstruction has never done anything but interpret this extraordinary phrase of Hamlet’s; to interpret it in the sense in which the hermeneut interprets, interpret it in the sense in which the actor interprets, interpret it in the sense of the play or the performance, interpret it in the sense in which one must still, beyond reading and theater, interpret interpretation.\nAnd if this interpretation is neither America nor in America, not only America nor in America, then what is America today? What is deconstruction doing at this very moment in America? Before outlining a partial and preliminary response to that question, here is a third step.\n3. Third step. If the slash between “is” and “in” says in silence something about what “The time is out of joint” may mean, if that is the very affirmation of deconstruction, then the good and the wicked fairies that for more than thirty years have been following "},"document":{"title":"Deconstruction is/in America","author":"Anselm Haverkamp","publisher":"New York University Press","id":50,"isbn":"9780814735190"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_29","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/keynote.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_29\">","css_selector":"#page_29","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_29\"]"},"next_location_id":12601,"previous_location_id":12599}]
