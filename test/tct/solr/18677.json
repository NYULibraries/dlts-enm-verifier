To put everything—words, fields, categories, sensuous qualities—in an inadequate image of relationships: A language is composed of hyperthin threads in a unique hypercomplex web, no strand of which can be touched without transferring its particular tension to all the others and changing the pattern of tensions of the whole web. The language always responds like a single complex being.\nThough I will not stress the point, the description of each language as a unique individual can be extended to each dialect and argot. Distinct groups of the speakers of a language are likely to develop a distinct vocabulary, imagery, and set of idioms, as well as their own variations of syntax. For instance, the negativity and violence embodied in the argot of criminals express defiance of the larger society, while its inventive playfulness expresses a jaunty attitude in the face of enmity and trouble. The technicality of criminal argots is also a professional advantage, even a need, while its secrecy gives psychological comfort. Each argot evidently bears the exact marks of the time, place, and circumstances in which it was invented and used.\nIt is not difficult to press the individuality of language to the paradoxical extreme by now familiar to us. Condillac wrote, “It is enough to study a human being for a while to learn his language; I say his language, for everyone has his own according to his passions,” and “the same words spoken by the same mouth have quite different significations” (Aarsleff 1982, 344). In the words of another French thinker, Turgot, “Neither two human beings, nor perhaps the same human being at different times, attach precisely the same idea to the same words” (Aarsleff 1982, 344).\nDespite this emphasis on the individual, it was agreed that social life minimized the differences between individuals. Humboldt’s view was that the predisposition for language was inseparable from that "},"document":{"title":"The Dilemma of Context","author":"Ben-Ami Scharfstein","publisher":"New York University Press","id":70,"isbn":"9780814779163"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":27201,"display_name":"Aarsleff, Hans"},"id":70617,"ring_next":18678,"ring_prev":18675},{"basket":{"id":27307,"display_name":"Condillac, Étienne Bonnot de"},"id":70838,"ring_next":18547,"ring_prev":18547},{"basket":{"id":27314,"display_name":"Criminal subculture"},"id":70855,"ring_next":18576,"ring_prev":18576},{"basket":{"id":27429,"display_name":"Humboldt, Wilhelm von"},"id":71072,"ring_next":18678,"ring_prev":18675},{"basket":{"id":27680,"display_name":"Turgot, A.
