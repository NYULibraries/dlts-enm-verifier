In refiguring the enactive relations of nonidentity that join meaning and medium, cognition to physical bodies, and subjectivities to technological apparati, Patchwork Girl refuses to bracket the meaning of discourse from these material forces while it also inquires into distinct modes of engaging and registering those matters. It foregrounds the technics and technical apparati that allow specific kinds of relations to and very selective engagements with material bodies. The work, thus, walks through the door Luhmann leaves open for a nonrepresentational relation to the ontological, yet social systems theory refuses to walk through.\nIf read in terms of recent new materialist systems thinking, such as Karen Barad’s “relational ontology” based on Niels Bohr’s quantum physics-philosophy, Patchwork Girl’s inquiries into shifting technics can be understood as inquiries into the “intra-actions,” through which distinct agencies become perceivable and meaningful under specific technological and discursive conditions.59 Patchwork Girl is similarly concerned to explore the technics or material practices that enact “agential cuts” between subject and object. In Barad’s account, it is through that enactive relation or “intra-action” that shifting human and nonhuman boundaries are delineated and that distinct subjects and objects are defined, in contradistinction to a typical conception of interaction occurring between two wholly independent, preexisting entities. Barad develops a concept of “intra-activity,” as opposed to interactivity, to describe the ongoing horizon of processes through which “phenomena,” in her Bohrian terminology, mutually enact entities that then "},"document":{"title":"Tactics of the Human: Experimental Technics in American Fiction","author":"Shackelford, Laura","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":26,"isbn":"9780472120680"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":6594,"display_name":"Cooper, Melinda, Life as Surplus"},"id":21268,"ring_next":5451,"ring_prev":5451}],"localid":"page_74","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap002.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_74\">","css_selector":"#page_74","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_74\"]"},"next_location_id":5354,"previous_location_id":5352}]
