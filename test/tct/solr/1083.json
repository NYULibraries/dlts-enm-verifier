This powerfully contrasts with Solaar’s (1998) own assertion that he is “representing the French rhyme” [Je représente la rime hexagonale].\nWhile Marti marvels at rappers’ attachment to French republican values—“Could rappers reveal themselves to be more republican than the Republic? It may be a bit excessive to say so, but they all display a profound attachment to some of its values. The republican motto ‘Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité’ is not without its appeal [n’est pas sans leur déplaire]”—he nevertheless describes them as “French on paper, a little less in the soul” (2005, pp. 235, 201). Similarly, while professor of French and Francophone literatures Valérie Orlando (2003) acknowledges rappers’ desire to be considered French—she cites a rapper as saying, “I’m French, formed by the Republican School system. I’m a young Maghrebian who mixes two languages, Arabic and French. Voilà! I’m a Muslim Made in France!” (2003, p. 402)—she nevertheless concludes that “the Beurs17 seek to negotiate new identities for themselves somewhere between French and Other” (2003, p. 413, emphasis mine). By refusing to consent to rappers’ assertions of French identity, these scholars theoretically reproduce the process of exclusion from full participation in French society hip-hop artists are denouncing in their work. In stark contrast to France’s official policy of color blindness, they subtly suggest that one cannot truly be French and black, brown, and/or Muslim (despite the fact that Islam is the second most widely practiced religion in France after Roman Catholicism).\nThe racial undertones of this positioning are indeed difficult to miss. For instance, after criticizing Solaar for using “turns of phrase that are poetic and ‘close to home’ [bien de chez nous],” Boucher cites Fanon—“Nothing more sensational than a black expressing himself correctly, since, really, he assumes the white world” (cited in Boucher, 1998, p. 123)—to suggest that Solaar’s self-positioning as representative of French culture (I represent the French rhyme) compromises his black male identity. Boucher celebrates, on the other hand, the more “hard core,” “violent,” and “pure and hard [pure et dur]” rap of those who “want to keep their ‘authenticity’” (Boucher, 1998, pp. 120, 123, 124, 124). This results in a gangsta rap-inspired characterization of “authentic” ethnic/black identity as violent, threatening, and refusing to “integrate” that ultimately resonates with the discourse of ultra-conservative politicians and journalists who paint the banlieue as a site of social strife threatening France’s core identity. Scholars in the United States have pointed to the deeply essentializing nature of a similar process of definition in U.S. rap that “denies and silences a wide range of black urban ghetto experiences and points of view” and ultimately serves as “a cover for perpetuating gross stereotypes about black people” (Rose, 2008, pp. 139, 141).\nAssociating authenticity with violence and street credibility also positions\n"},"document":{"title":"Imagining the Global: Transnational Media and Popular Culture Beyond East and West","author":"Darling-Wolf, Fabienne","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":6,"isbn":"9780472120796"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1069,"display_name":"Boucher, Manuel"},"id":3099,"ring_next":1084,"ring_prev":1082},{"basket":{"id":1152,"display_name":"Fanon, Frantz"},"id":3334,"ring_next":26561,"ring_prev":29587},{"basket":{"id":1170,"display_name":"France -- national identity"},"id":3375,"ring_next":1089,"ring_prev":1080},{"basket":{"id":1171,"display_name":"France -- racial tensions"},"id":3389,"ring_next":1137,"ring_prev":1080},{"basket":{"id":1262,"display_name":"Islam"},"id":3738,"ring_next":19182,"ring_prev":1081},{"basket":{"id":1344,"display_name":"Marti, Pierre-Antoine"},"id":3993,"ring_next":1072,"ring_prev":1082},{"basket":{"id":1403,"display_name":"Orlando, Valérie"},"id":4173,"ring_next":1089,"ring_prev":1089},{"basket":{"id":1268,"display_name":"other, the"},"id":4180,"ring_next":24180,"ring_prev":1009},{"basket":{"id":1484,"display_name":"Solaar, MC"},"id":4386,"ring_next":1121,"ring_prev":1082}],"localid":"page_92","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter04.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_92\">","css_selector":"#page_92","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_92\"]"},"next_location_id":1084,"previous_location_id":1082}]
