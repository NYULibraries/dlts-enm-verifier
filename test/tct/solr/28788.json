[{"id":28788,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"102-page_5","content_descriptor":"page 5","text":"with the niceness that was expected of me, I was quickly brought back into the fold. I can remember questioning an administrator in high school about what I perceived to be inequitable treatment based on the families to which students belonged. I can also remember being told that I was not simply wrong but also disrespectful and inappropriate in my accusations. For me, school was not the place where I learned about equity, oppression, or injustice. It was not until my early adult years that I started noticing these things. And it was only through explicit exposure to potentially uncomfortable concepts, relationships with people who were willing to challenge my worldview, and compelling evidence that injustice and unfairness were rampant in my community that I was able to see what was previously invisible to me. Once I started paying attention, I quickly became angry that my schooling was so inadequate. I was academically prepared to be very successful in college and beyond, and I had the critical thinking and writing skills that served as a helpful foundation, but I was never asked to think critically or write about things like racism, institutional oppression, homophobia, or social-class injustice. To have engaged in these kinds of issues would have been inconsistent with the nice White girl who I was and who I was expected to be.\n      When I spend time in schools now, I see the same patterns. When I spend time with my current students who are aspiring and practicing teachers and administrators, I see the same patterns. When I interact with my colleagues, who are seasoned educators charged with preparing future educators, I see the same patterns. And why wouldnâ€™t I? These norms of niceness are powerful motivators for educators in particular. Whiteness provides a fruitful context for these patterns, and whiteness is further reinforced by the recurrence of these same patterns.\n      Whiteness refers to structural arrangements and ideologies of race dominance. Racial power and inequities are at the core of whiteness, but all forms of power and inequity create and perpetuate whiteness. The function of whiteness is to maintain the status quo, and although White people most often benefit from whiteness, some people of color have tapped into the ideological components of whiteness for their own financial and educational benefits. Whiteness maintains power and privilege by perpetuating and legitimating the status quo while simultaneously maintaining a veneer of neutrality, equality, and compassion. Understanding the links between whiteness and diversity-related educational policy and practice is, therefore, an important, and yet relatively unexplored, task for educators.\n      To understand whiteness, it is helpful to step back and consider the meaning of race and racism. Race is primarily a socially constructed phenomenon, which means that people create race and give it significance. "},"document":{"title":"Educated in Whiteness","author":"Angelina E.
