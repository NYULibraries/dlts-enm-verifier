There’s no better example of this than the higher forms of love that involve the pleasure of sacrifice and the capacity to bear suffering in deference to the object of one’s love. This is the kind of love—epitomized by Christian agape—that Freud characterized as “genuine” in his paper on transference-love (see chapter 5). The need to eradicate suffering once and for all by deadening one’s experience of it is now attributed to the “death” drive. Hence it becomes a factor not only in pathological forms of suffering, specifically, but also plays a part in our everyday preoccupation with avoiding the kind of hardships that are inherent in life itself.\nOn closer examination, is the death drive actually a drive toward death? Is it an “instinct” in the sense that we usually understand this term? The answer to both of these questions is “no.” The common tendency to take Freud’s terms too literally probably accounts for some of the opposition he encountered with this revision of the drive theory. In the first place, Freud didn’t use the term instinct in the sense of animal instinct. He even referred to instincts in the New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis as “our mythology” (1964c, 95). In a recent review of Freud’s instinct theory, Andre Green (1991, 124–41) suggests that Freud’s conception of drive is actually metaphysical, because it isn’t specifically rooted in conventional notions of biology (136). Freud’s so-called drive model, which he tried to justify with biological theories of organicity, serves to account for life’s aims in terms that are predominantly ontological. Because Freud doesn’t couch these questions in spiritual or even sociological terminology, it leaves him open to the charge of advocating an exclusively biological model that neglects humanistic and intersubjective considerations. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, his argument in favor of a “death drive” is essentially an existential theory. If we don’t give Freud the room to explore its relationship to biology, it would remain a purely psychological conception—but a psychology that is cut off from its roots, without a body.\nThis is why the word death in Freud’s newer, more philosophical formulation shouldn’t be taken so literally. When Freud was told by one of his followers that his notion of Thanatos was remarkably similar to the Buddhist conception of Nirvana—the elimination of all strife by overcoming desire—he promptly nicknamed his death instinct the “Nirvana complex.” This is because the aim of the “death drive” isn’t literally death. Its goal is simply to eradicate suffering, an aim that, were it achieved, would eliminate life itself—figuratively speaking.
