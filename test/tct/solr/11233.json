[{"id":11233,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"45-page_201","content_descriptor":"page 201","text":"Patient K, for example, reported the traumatic experience of his sexual attempts in puberty, where girls of his age had made fun of him for his small penis. Patient G, on the other hand, still slept with his mother in one bed at the time of therapy. He often dreamed that he was lying on top of somebody whom he could smother, or that someone was lying on top and smothering him. Sometimes this was accompanied by the fear of being buried alive. Then he would wake up bathed in sweat. In association with these dreams he remembered the war, and it occurred to him that, as they were walking across a field in the war, his mother had in fact thrown herself on top of him, and he had heard the sound of planes and shooting in the distance. (If we try to understand this memory in the psychoanalytic tradition as a “primal scene fantasy,” although the patient had no associations confirming this, we might stress the overwhelming closeness of the mother and the abstract distance of the father who was in the war and who was here represented only in the form of threatening sounds.)\nIt is often noticeable that pedophiles use their hands and fingers as more or less the only penis substitute with which they try to penetrate the dangerous female openings. This substitute formation could be a regressive step toward the clinging pattern. In young primates, when the clinging need is frustrated, a number of activities with the hands can be observed as surrogates, ranging from “grooming” (delousing) themselves and others, to mutual touching of the hands, and tickling with the index finger. This kind of exploratory approach using the index finger can also often be observed in young adult primates (Goodall 1988). Older and sexually exhausted male animals often react to genital presentations by females with tender grooming behavior instead of sexual activity. Here, too, male animals show clearly that when sexual stimulation is obstructed, it is replaced by caring behavior.\nBut what triggers off this regression into the early clinging pattern? Perhaps early traumatizations caused by a mother figure perceived as overly powerful and not counterbalanced by a father cause pedophiles to attribute the castration threat to the mother. Indications of conscious and unconscious fear of castration can in fact be found among pedophiles much more often and more clearly than fully developed oedipal conflict constellations (Berner 1993).\n"},"document":{"title":"Ferenczi’s Turn in Psychoanalysis","author":"Peter L.
