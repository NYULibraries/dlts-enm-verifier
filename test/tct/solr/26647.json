Winter carefully disavows any argument that the cognitive process he outlines is objective in the sense that it represents transcendental truth. He nevertheless suggests that language and cognition are “empirical constructs” that can be investigated in a manner meaningful for legal practice. He thinks that a “competent model of human knowledge” can be developed. And this competent model would, usefully, govern all our activism:\nThese are not merely academic issues of only epistemological concern. For many, the absence of grounding or foundations is a liberating phenomena, a momentary opening for other ways of being or other forms of life. They think they see a plasticity in the constructed nature of our cultural forms that permits dramatic, unconstrained social transformation. For those of us who perceive the injustice of the current social order, this is a seductive vision because it suggests a clear shot at effective social change. But it is mistaken, doomed to failure because it does not understand or take into account the constraints of the cognitive process, dependent on experience for the raw materials of the models by which it constructs the world. Because many (maybe even most) idealized cognitive models are grounded in social experience, these “raw materials” are often themselves cultural constructions shaped by normative social processes. In this way, our very ability to construct a world is already constrained by the cultural structures in which we are enmeshed. (Emphasis added)\nThis is an extraordinary grab for the mantle of expertise. Winter would discipline Utopian enthusiasts with his reliable scientist’s eye. He sneers at “the vogue misidentification of the arbitrary with the socially contingent” and at the mistaken assumption “that the lack of objective foundations means that there are no constraints.” His project is to map these constraints and to deliver untutored activists from their misguided urges for dramatic change. Winter will guide us safely through the “sedimented meanings” and “stabilized matrices” that comprise the legal landscape. His knowledge will help activists be shrewd strategists because “in the end, the effective practice of constitutional politics cannot rely on purely interpretive efforts. For the ultimate persuasiveness of these interpretations will depend on their ability to take root in the actual experiences and institutions of the culture.”18\nAt one level this is a laudable call to broad-based social activism and a useful recognition that law is written not merely in ink, but in the currency of blood. Winter might be read, innocuously enough, as reminding us of the limits of formal and institutional initiatives in effecting profound social "},"document":{"title":"Clarence Thomas and the Tough Love Crowd","author":"Ronald Suresh Roberts","publisher":"New York University Press","id":94,"isbn":"9780814774816"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_94","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch07.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_94\">","css_selector":"#page_94","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_94\"]"},"next_location_id":26648,"previous_location_id":26646}]
