In fact, as Eldon Eisenach notes, for Hobbes, “obedience to civil law is righteousness.”126 Hobbes wrote:\n\n[T]o teach . . . that Jesus was Christ, (that is to say, King,) and risen from the dead, is not to say, that men are bound after they beleeve it, to obey those that tell them so, against the laws, and commands of their Soveraigns; but that they shall doe wisely, to expect the coming of Christ hereafter, in Patience, and Faith, with Obedience to their present Magistrates.127\n\nFor one who is so often labeled an atheist,128 Hobbes displayed (often albeit implicitly) a striking commitment to Calvinist Reformed theology in his political theory. To Hobbes, the anarchy of the English Civil War and the interregnum opened a rare opportunity to break the shackles of tradition and to remake society. Christians could return to a pure or Reformed Christianity, and simultaneously, individuals could reconstitute the political society, establishing an “order based on reason and justice.”129 Moreover, even Hobbes’s vision of a reconstituted political society—his rationalistic argument in the first half of Leviathan—rested implicitly on a Calvinist Reformed foundation. Quite clearly, Hobbes’s conception of human nature as selfish, degraded, violent, and corrupt corresponded with the Reformed emphasis on human sinfulness and depravity. Furthermore, Hobbes’s entire notion of the social contract—a covenant establishing political society—reflected the Calvinist concept of the covenanting community, as manifested previously, for instance, in the Long Parliament’s Solemn League and Covenant.130 And the individualism inherent in both of these points—the selfish individual greedily pursuing his or her self-interest until choosing to agree to the covenant—mirrored the latent individualism of Calvinism, whereby each person stands alone before God, predestined for eternal salvation or damnation, with only the dictates of his or her conscience leading to the truth of Jesus.131 Furthermore, as already mentioned, Hobbes echoed standard New Testament and Calvinist antisemitism: the Old Testament and Jewish history prepared for the coming of Jesus; the Jews refused to accept Jesus even though he was their expected savior and Messiah; the Jews questioned Jesus because they did not know of eternal salvation; Christianity renewed and thus surpassed the Jewish covenant with God; and of course, the Jews were responsible for Jesus’ death.132\nAt a deeper level, Hobbes fully accepted the New Testament opposition between Christian spirituality and Jewish carnality, and used it as the implicit foundation for his theology and political theory. Indeed, Hobbes took Calvin’s radical disjunction between the spiritual and secular—which flowed from the New Testament opposition—even more seriously than "},"document":{"title":"Please don’t Wish me a Merry Christmas","author":"Stephen M.
