[{"id":21693,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"80-page_24","content_descriptor":"page 24","text":"Although white, middle-class lesbians have responded to mainstream feminism with much the same feeling of exclusion as have women marginalized by race or class, their situation differs in notable ways. Most centrally, whereas other groups of women have been historically (and in most cases, continue to be) underrepresented in the feminist movement, lesbians have been central to feminism from its earliest days and have actively participated in all of its undertakings. They have not always been visible as lesbians in these roles, sometimes because of individual choice but other times because of general anti-lesbian sentiment among feminists (Douglas 1990) or because their visibility as lesbians was seen as detrimental to the feminist movement (Kaye/Kantrowitz 1992;Mennis 1982; Rich 1986).\nNevertheless, despite the failure of the feminist movement to acknowledge or address many of the problems that lesbians face, some of the most influential, respected, and visible feminist writers have been lesbians. The very homophobia of the early women’s movement, as expressed by Betty Friedan’s labeling of lesbians as a “lavender herring” and, later, a “lavender menace,” testifies to the presence of large numbers of lesbians in the movement (Gomez 1995, 35). Thus a tension exists between the clear influence lesbians have had on feminist politics and theory and the feminist movement’s history of dismissing as “special interests” the concerns of lesbians.\nToo often, heterosexual feminists fail to recognize the connections between lesbian oppression and the oppression of all women.11 Yet only when feminists have crystallized this connection can we recognize the importance of lesbian liberation for all women. Because “heterosexuality is a social organization of power … that enforces gender inequality between biological males and females” (Blasius 1994, 76), any female rejection of male dominance is often read as a refusal of heterosexuality as well. Thus the hatred and fear of lesbians and the social forces that make lesbianism stigmatized and invisible constitute a threat to any woman who fails to conform to a traditional “woman’s role,” whatever her sexual orientation. This includes the woman who, for any reason, chooses not to marry, not to bear or to raise children, or not to live in a situation of financial and emotional dependence on a man regardless of her marital status. It includes the woman who chooses a nontraditional career, who fails to dress or speak or behave in ways that are appropriately “feminine,” who sleeps with many different men, or who refuses to sleep with a certain man or any men (regardless of her sexual orientation). It includes, as well, the woman who refuses to signal her possession by a man in even symbolic ways, as by choosing not to wear a wedding ring or by keeping her own last name after marriage.\n"},"document":{"title":"Freedom to Differ","author":"Diane Helene Miller","publisher":"New York University Press","id":80,"isbn":"9780814755969"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":14357,"display_name":"Friedan, Betty"},"id":82296,"ring_next":8757,"ring_prev":20570},{"basket":{"id":32808,"display_name":"Heterosexual women -- and lesbians"},"id":82438,"ring_next":21689,"ring_prev":21689},{"basket":{"id":32807,"display_name":"Heterosexual women -- effects of homophobia on"},"id":82452,"ring_next":21745,"ring_prev":21776},{"basket":{"id":32902,"display_name":"Lesbians -- oppression of"},"id":82734,"ring_next":21706,"ring_prev":21692},{"basket":{"id":16095,"display_name":"marriage"},"id":82902,"ring_next":21819,"ring_prev":21686},{"basket":{"id":33096,"display_name":"Voice and visibility -- as unacceptable for lesbians"},"id":83487,"ring_next":21713,"ring_prev":21747}],"localid":"page_24","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch1.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_24\">","css_selector":"#page_24","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_24\"]"},"next_location_id":21694,"previous_location_id":21692}]
