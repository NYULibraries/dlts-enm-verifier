After seeing these values at work, it becomes much easier to explain the underlying recursive patterns at work.\nWhile I have emphasized how new values are changing journalism, it is also important to pause for a moment and recall what remains the same: the constraints upon news that have shaped journalism production from the 1960s and beyond are still influencing newswork.
