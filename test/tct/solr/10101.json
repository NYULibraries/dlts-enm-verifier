The mere “trappings and the suits of woe” do not help much in performing this arduous labor:\n\nTis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,Nor customary suits of solemn black,Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,Nor the dejected havior of the visage,Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,For they are actions that a man might play,But I have that within which passeth show—These but the trappings and the suits of woe.\n(1.2.77–86).\n\nWhat Hamlet needs above all is time to deal with that within which passeth show, time for working through his grief, which is exactly what he does not have when the cascading events represented in the play begin. In his discussion of mourning Bowlby repeatedly emphasizes that one of the most important factors in handling loss is the prolonged duration of the mourning process, even in normal as distinguished from abnormal mourning (1980, 8, 10, 100–103, 130). And as Freud so well understood, what is so painful about mourning is that it is always conflictful. Loss begets hatred toward the abandoning other before the work of mourning can eventuate in a benign internalization of the departed other. It may therefore be that Hamlet’s delay in taking revenge, a delay he himself experiences as intolerable, corresponds in part to the time-consuming restructuring of representations of self and other that the mourning process requires of us.\nLoss begets anger at the lost object. This anger takes the irrational form of wishing for the death of the lost object, a wish that gives rise, in turn, to fear of losing the precious object, a fear at odds with the impulse to destroy that object, thereby creating an unconscious conflict that produces the kinds of inaction and deflected action—such as play-acting—that constitute the very stuff and matrix of the play, not just with regard to Hamlet and his father-surrogates but also with respect to his relationship with his “lost” mother and the “lost” Ophelia.
