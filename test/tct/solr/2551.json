The 1984 act created determinate, mandatory minimum sentences (which took discretionary power from judges and put it in the hands of prosecutors), established a sentencing commission “to devise strict sentencing guidelines,” eliminated federal parole, and “expanded the government's ability to seize property and cash from convicted, or even accused drug dealers, in civil or criminal court.” What was seized went to the police who had done the seizing, which enhanced their eagerness to “collaborate with federal agencies and try drug cases in federal court.”24 The 1986 act added twenty-nine new mandatory minimum sentences.

The early months of 1993, Mauer says, “represented a time of cautious optimism for criminal justice reform” thanks to a growing awareness of racial disparities in the criminal justice system and numerous well-articulated proposals of alternatives to prison.
