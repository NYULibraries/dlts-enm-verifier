Not mentioning race or sexual orientation at all when cues that automatically trigger the stereotypes associated with these characteristics abound promotes unconscious discrimination against members of these stereotyped groups. To control a bad habit, a person first must recall it consciously, and then intentionally inhibit it as he or she responds in ways consistent with his or her personally-endorsed beliefs and attitudes.\nTiming of Rationality-Enhancing Group References. Assuming that an attorney representing a member of a stereotyped group seeks to make rationality-enhancing group references for her client, what is the best setting for such references? Salutary group references may be made in a variety of settings, including voir dire, opening statements, presentation of the case in chief, closing arguments, jury instructions, and jury deliberations. All these settings present opportunities for legal actors to encourage prospective or sitting fact finders to guard against their prejudice-like responses. Voir dire, for example, may present an excellent opportunity to search not only for avowedly prejudiced venire persons, but also to signal to prospective jurors the importance of consciously monitoring their habitual responses to the stereotyped litigant.\nAnother favorable setting for rationality-enhancing group references may be during opening statements. A striking illustration of both a lawyer’s efforts to activate a jury’s nonprejudiced impulses in this setting, and a court’s misguided application of color-blind formalism to his efforts, comes from a tort case pitting a pharmaceutical company against a low-income Black infant and her mother.106 The mother and child sought damages for serious injuries the child suffered from using the "},"document":{"title":"Negrophobia and Reasonable Racism","author":"Jody David Armour","publisher":"New york University Press","id":67,"isbn":"9780814706404"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":26350,"display_name":"discrimination -- unconscious"},"id":68538,"ring_next":18020,"ring_prev":18009},{"basket":{"id":26335,"display_name":"formalism"},"id":68561,"ring_next":18019,"ring_prev":17983},{"basket":{"id":19977,"display_name":"juries"},"id":68612,"ring_next":17872,"ring_prev":18015}],"localid":"page_151","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch06.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_151\">","css_selector":"#page_151","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_151\"]"},"next_location_id":18018,"previous_location_id":18016}]
