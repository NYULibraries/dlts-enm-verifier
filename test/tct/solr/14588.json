The greater the rewards and the fitness accorded to individual and group behavior, the greater the need for restraint and the greater the capacity for learning by information transfers, signals, and the passage of adaptive capacities in nongenetic forms of acquired—that is, learned—traits. To carry this down generations we must bond to authority figures, generally parents, and have a genetically evolved capacity to copy, or learn from them (Waddington 1960). In this sense, authority, and heeding authority models, aids fitness, if the information being learned contributes to increased reproductive success.\nMorality: The Transmission of Tradition\nLearning capacity and tradition imply another biologically based trait system—morality or oughtness. The passing of information and instructions through learning and authority subsumes the inherent ability to label some variants right, others wrong. More broadly, and logically, long-term and stable tool traditions such as presapiens Mousterian, and the later and more various paleolithic industries associated with the rise of our own species, employed reinforcements to learning over several millenia of fairly stabilized transmissions of behavioral features through nongenetic means. That is to say, for cultural tradition to appear and obtain its dominant position in our adaptation as a species, there had to be ways to restrict behavioral variances in order to sustain the identifiable cultural patterns down the generations. The most efficient form of heritable transmission is through normalizing selection in which variants are disfavored and previously evolved patterns are favored in the learning process. Other explanations would logically involve copying, which produces more frequent variations, or each generation learning the tradition anew, which would produce even more variants. Logically then it is plausible that heritable transmission of tradition by learning requires acquiring a sense of “right” and “wrong” through instructions, followed by “right” and “wrong” behavioral responses for doing things “culturally.” It follows that a capacity to evaluate one’s own behavior and that of others in moral terms is a basic prerequisite "},"document":{"title":"Embracing the Other","author":"Pearl M.
