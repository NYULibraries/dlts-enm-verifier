As more and more people acquire empathic capacity, the whole nation (as if it were a linear aggregate of individuals) would break off from the yoke of tradition and enter the threshold of modernization.\nVarious criticisms made of Lerner should be by now familiar, such as (see Lee, 1980, pp. 17–24): (a) rigidly segregating tradition from modernity instead of fostering a creative synthesis; (b) using a psychological variable (empathy) to explain the macro-societal transformation to the exclusion of acute structural constraints, global domination, imperialism, and post-colonial conditions; (c) imposing the Western pathway to modernization as a universal process, and thus contradicting the historical evidence showing a multiplicity of modernization routes in the West itself; and, also, (4) ignoring the differences in structural conditions between late development (the Third World) and early development (the European nations).\nLerner declared (1958, p. 79) that “what America is—to condense a rule more powerful than its numerous exceptions—the modernizing Middle East seeks to become.” In his view, the Middle East would have to walk through the same linear path that the United States had trodden. The American experience was not only relevant to the geographical region called “the West” but was projected as a “globally” valid model. He rejected the calls made by the emerging nations for alternative models as “ethnocentric predicament” and “a formidable obstacle to modernization” (p. ix). Lerner’s logically circular claim on a linear model of modernization, however, flies in the face of historical evidence presented by Moore (1967) and Tilly (1975). Moore showed that there were multiple pathways to modernization among the Western nations. Tilly argued that the Western model was an unintended consequence of an extractive, repressive, and coercive process; it was indeed considered a “lucky shot” that could not be reproduced.\nCommitted to a teleological vision, Lerner argued that the whole theoretical landscape required “some principle of unity in diversity” (p. 77). What does this mean? “By making explicit the regularities we document the process; by noting the deviations we locate each country in its proper phase” (p. 89). Generality subsumes exceptions. He thus postulated Turkey and Lebanon at the top of modernism (read: Westernization), Egypt and Syria in the middle, with Jordan and Iran at the bottom. Methodologically, Lerner set out to craft a series of six single-country narratives, which Harold D. Lasswell praised as “brilliantly arresting” (cited on the book cover). Each country narrative was a mix of historical facts, anecdotes, and secondary\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2206,"display_name":"Egypt"},"id":6927,"ring_next":7151,"ring_prev":2006},{"basket":{"id":2294,"display_name":"Lasswell, Harold D."},"id":7446,"ring_next":8195,"ring_prev":1893},{"basket":{"id":2328,"display_name":"Middle East"},"id":7698,"ring_next":2093,"ring_prev":2091},{"basket":{"id":2409,"display_name":"social change"},"id":8129,"ring_next":2117,"ring_prev":1981},{"basket":{"id":2425,"display_name":"Third world"},"id":8212,"ring_next":2095,"ring_prev":1961},{"basket":{"id":2434,"display_name":"United States -- Media studies"},"id":8297,"ring_next":2093,"ring_prev":2090}],"localid":"page_205","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter10.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_205\">","css_selector":"#page_205","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_205\"]"},"next_location_id":2093,"previous_location_id":2091}]
