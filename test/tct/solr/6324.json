Blankfein, Goldman's chairman and chief executive, who has become a focus for criticism over executive pay. In 2007, Mr. Blankfein was paid $68 million, a Wall Street record. He did not receive a bonus in 2008.\n \nPromptly at 8 a.m., Bowley checked the wires for results. He saw that The Journal had posted the earnings before The Times. “It's on The Journal!” he shouted, and yelled out the number to Getzfred. Bowley confirmed the numbers independently.

Notably, the story had only been edited by Getzfred: there was no copy editor on this kind of breaking story until after the story had gone up on the Web site. However, for a story to make it into the print edition, it might be copy edited anywhere from two to sometimes seven times before public consumption.8\nBowley's posted story was only the first version of the piece, and he would continue to work on it throughout the day.
