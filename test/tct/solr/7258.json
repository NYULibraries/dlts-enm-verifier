Shresthova also connected to American Muslim youth networks online to explore how new media complements, and expands upon, face-to-face encounters.\nPost-9/11 American Muslim Youth and Precarious Publics\n“I didn’t realize it was so big,” Walidah, a young American Muslim woman from the Midwest, almost whispered as she circled the noisy construction site at Ground Zero. Walidah had come to Manhattan to participate in MPAC’s June 2012 Young Leaders Media Summit. She took several pictures with her cell phone, her expression distraught and pensive.

They also spoke about “fear” as a key dimension of their post-9/11 experience.\nMany of the American Muslim youth we interviewed shared experiences of anti-Muslim prejudice growing up in America, which confirmed the findings of other studies of this population. A survey of American Muslim youth conducted by Selcuk R. Sirin and Michelle Fine (2009) found that “88 percent of the participants reported having been subjected to at least one act of discrimination because they were Muslim” (87).
