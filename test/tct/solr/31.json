Fun to do? If it should be, at least as presented in secondary schools, it is not. Most students would be sympathetic to James Joyce, who said, “History is a nightmare from which I must awake!”1 In our enthusiasm to cover the syllabus, to show the big picture, the vast canvas of history, we have squeezed both the fun and the fascination out. To go from “Plato to NATO” we take the flesh from the stories and deliver only the skeleton.2 Typically, we ask students to commit this to memory and regurgitate it at exam time instead of teaching the detective work—the critical skills of the historian applied to evidence from the past. The most able teachers have shown us for centuries that we can make history engaging while we teach its most important lessons. Now, as we are able to explore the affinities between game-based learning and the goals and tools of history teaching, we have some new tools at our disposal to make history “playful.”\nIn a 2006 article, Richard Van Eck argued that it is time that discussions about digital game-based learning (DGBL) move beyond research that has, by this point, already convincingly demonstrated its efficacy as a place for, or site of, learning.3 We need to move on now, he argues, to create “research explaining why DGBL is engaging and effective” and to provide “practical guidance for how (when, with whom, and under what conditions) games can be integrated into the learning process to maximize their learning potential.” We take up Van Eck’s challenge to explain and prescribe appropriate uses for history-related games as we explore links between our DGBL history project, the Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History, and recent "},"document":{"title":"Pastplay: Teaching and Learning History with Technology","author":"Kee, Kevin","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":1,"isbn":"9780472120482"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":89,"display_name":"game-based learning"},"id":307,"ring_next":40,"ring_prev":26},{"basket":{"id":157,"display_name":"playfulness, in learning history"},"id":567,"ring_next":33,"ring_prev":30},{"basket":{"id":191,"display_name":"stories"},"id":665,"ring_next":43,"ring_prev":3699},{"basket":{"id":201,"display_name":"teaching -- with technology"},"id":711,"ring_next":37,"ring_prev":278}],"localid":"page_23","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter01.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_23\">","css_selector":"#page_23","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_23\"]"},"next_location_id":32,"previous_location_id":30}]
