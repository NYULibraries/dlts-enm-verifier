Even vacations frequently separated men from their families.22\nFamily time for men may have begun to increase as early as the 1880s. Certainly by the 1920s evidence of heightened paternal involvement with families began to proliferate. Meanwhile, dating activities brought men into social contact with women earlier, during high school or college. For the middle class, dating was a social and sexual activity removed from active thoughts of marriage, at least until the college years, but it represented a huge departure from the male-oriented socializing of the nineteenth century. Not surprisingly, lodge membership began to plummet during the 1920s.23 Within marriage, there was an increase in social activities that joined husband and wife, as studies like that of Middletown suggested. Card playing and other home-based entertainments brought the sexes into contact with each other, reducing gender distinctions in social patterns. Parties that sometimes involved carefully, if subtly, regulated sexual games among husbands and wives from different families began to appear in the middle-class social scene from the 1920s onward.24\nIn a variety of respects, then, from the teen years onward, social contact between men and women increased rather strikingly over the levels of the Victorian era. The term “companionate marriage” has been coined to describe precisely these social patterns, which were also recommended by the new breed of marriage counselors.25 This was no breakthrough toward gender equality, but it was nevertheless a substantial shift in the interactions between men and women. Even as the change confirmed women’s domestic role by emphasizing family companionship, it also signaled the need to adjust some of the emotional disparities that had been fundamental to Victorian culture.\nObviously, new contacts increased the pressures against specific emotions like jealousy. Particularly before the rise of “steady” dating late in the 1930s, dating deliberately involved contacts with various individuals from the opposite sex, which burdened a jealous temperament almost unbearably. Increased socializing might also, as Esquire noted, have prompted some rethinking of love, on grounds that transcendent closeness amid daily socializing was too much of a good thing.26\nThe larger implications of these new social patterns affected overall "},"document":{"title":"American Cool","author":"Peter N.
