As lesbians began to develop a culture and communities of their own, they also began to desire a history of their own. Modeling themselves after the Black civil rights movement and other racial/ethnic movements—a process that will be explored in detail later in this chapter—they searched for the shared history that would give them a sense of shared origins and shared fate. Early collections of lesbian and gay writings mythologized Sappho, reconstructed ancient Greece as the golden era of male homosexuality, and pointed with pride to historical figures whose personal papers revealed passions for same-sex lovers. But a lesbian history was difficult to construct because the concept of the lesbian as a type of person is a recent invention and because the repression of women’s sexuality had ensured little record of women’s sexual activities in the past. Lesbian history could not, therefore, be constructed on the basis of sexual behavior.32 The desexualization of lesbianism conveniently opened the door for the construction of a lesbian history.\nIn turn, the construction of a lesbian history in the absence of historical information about sexuality helped construct contemporary lesbianism in desexualized terms. For example, Blanche Wiesen Cook suggested that all independent women who choose to nurture and support other women are lesbians.33 Using this definition, any strong woman-identified historical figure could be claimed as an ancestor of the modern lesbian, despite a lack of information about her sexual behavior. 34 For example, Brown saw herself as belonging to a long history of women who had become “women-identified” after they “questioned the system and found it destructive to themselves” (1976e:79). Carpenter referred to the leading figures in the Girls’ Work Movement as “spinsters,” and commented that the suppression of women’s sexuality meant that “there was no public discussion of lesbianism and rarely any acknowledgment that these ‘splendid,’ ‘dedicated’ and strong examples of ‘magnificent womanhood’ were in fact lesbians” (1988:171—172). Carpenter, who presented no evidence of these women’s sexual habits, was either using a definition of lesbianism similar to Cook’s, or she was assuming that these strong, unmarried women did in fact engage in lesbian sex of which, of course, there is no record.35\n"},"document":{"title":"Bisexuality and the Challenge to Lesbian Politics","author":"Paula C.
