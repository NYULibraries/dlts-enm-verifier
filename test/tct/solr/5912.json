For this to happen, educators must redesign how behaviors and activities are framed and enacted, to better leverage the backgrounds, experiences, interests, and cultural understandings of students as foundations and sources for high intellectual performances that are viably connected to the world beyond school. This world and student experiences in it are increasingly represented in and realized though digital media. I believe that the unit in Teen Second Life emitted glimmers of possibilities for new realities in the place that we call school.\nFor a number of reasons, Ms. Glide could not have instituted this curricular unit without the support of members of the TEACH Project and the work of Ms. Canon in particular. It was reminiscent of how Ms. Young was integral to the work in the first semester of Ms. Foster's class. Perhaps this indicates the need to have a technology coordinator on site at schools as a central component of the overall educational mission. But it should also be remembered that without Ms. Young in the second semester, Ms. Foster continued to extend the uses of technology in her classes as her own confidence and competence grew through her teaching practices. This was a reflection of how teachers needed to continually develop by engaging in new learning themselves.\nMs. Glide became an example of a teacher who was continually engaged in learning that was new, in the Teen Second Life unit and afterward in her teaching practice. During the professional development sessions, she and other teachers were guided on downloading Second Life, building their own avatars, and practicing the basic movements, navigation skills, and communicative capabilities of the program. This was partially why she felt comfortable attempting the unit with her class. Her changing understanding of her practice continued after this unit that took place toward the end of the school year. For example, she wrote to me with an outline of a project that she wanted to do during the summer with some of her students: “I've been thinking about trying to pioneer some kind of class during the summer that would allow me and my students to work remotely—some kind of electronic blackboard or blog site. The idea would be to have students working continuously on digital projects and using technology to give them immediate feedback. I feel like it could continue some of the work that we started in spring semester.”\nMs. Glide had seen that the dynamics of her class had changed dramatically while the unit was going on, and she wanted to continue the students' development as well as hers. I have described earlier how their "},"document":{"title":"Digital Tools in Urban Schools: Mediating a Remix of Learning","author":"Mahiri, Jabari","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":28,"isbn":"9780472027606"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":7153,"display_name":"learning -- teacher engagement in"},"id":23203,"ring_next":5935,"ring_prev":5935},{"basket":{"id":7294,"display_name":"professional development (PD) sessions -- on Second Life"},"id":23510,"ring_next":5880,"ring_prev":5881},{"basket":{"id":7323,"display_name":"teachers -- continually engaged in learning"},"id":23592,"ring_next":5935,"ring_prev":5935},{"basket":{"id":7334,"display_name":"teachers -- technology support for"},"id":23639,"ring_next":5870,"ring_prev":5888},{"basket":{"id":7364,"display_name":"technology specialist -- need for"},"id":23732,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":7376,"display_name":"Teen Second Life -- teacher training in use of"},"id":23783,"ring_next":5880,"ring_prev":5881}],"localid":"page_120","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap04.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_120\">","css_selector":"#page_120","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_120\"]"},"next_location_id":5913,"previous_location_id":5911}]
