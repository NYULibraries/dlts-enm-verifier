Kipling thus presents the gaze as unidirectional and chimerical, yet treacherous to both viewer and subject.\nIn different ways, both Salome Mad and “Mrs Bathurst” indicate that glamour is a concept inextricable from Marx's notion of commodity fetishism. Glamour, like commodity fetishism, is an intangible generator of indefinite desire; unlike commodity fetishism, however, glamour adheres to a person—more precisely, the image of a person—rather than an object or commodity. Mindful of Benjamin's Marxian reading of the passante in Charles Baudelaire, we can view glamour, like the passante, as a phantasmagoric abstraction of consumer capitalism, part of the “consumerist” or “image-centered” models of body and visuality that I discuss in chapter 2. Consumerism's new means of manipulating desire via vision and distance—as with large plate-glass windows and prominent department store displays—anticipated the spectatorship of filmic glamour.10\nIf glamour suggests a new visual-sexual order for the modern world, we have already seen how criminal science outlined a seemingly opposite modern relation between visuality and power. As I discuss in chapter 1, the decades preceding the 1896 emergence of cinema saw widespread innovation in the field of visual technology, and the disciplinary uses of vision were eagerly investigated as criminologists mined visual technology for means of identifying criminals and tightening social controls. Criminal theorists like Galton, Bertillon, Lombroso, and Ellis imagined the gaze in terms of knowledge rather than feeling; unlike consumerist appeals to vision, they considered the eye as powerful and controlling rather than vulnerable and desiring. Benjamin's distinction between “trace” and “aura” helps explain this crucial difference between criminological and consumerist notions of visibility: “The trace is appearance of a nearness, however far removed the thing that left it behind may be. The aura is appearance of a distance, however close the thing that calls it forth. In the trace, we gain possession of the thing; in the aura, it takes possession of us” (Arcades 447). The criminological gaze, we might say, apprehends the visible as what Benjamin calls trace, whereas the consumerist gaze perceives aura or glamour.\nFictional detectives like Sherlock Holmes operate in tandem with new criminological theories of vision, and the Holmes series thematizes the prospect of near-perfect surveillance and authority in modern criminal science. Tom Gunning has located a similar predisposition toward the criminological gaze in early cinema.11 He uses a 1904 U.S. film, A\n"},"document":{"title":"Framed: The New Woman Criminal in British Culture at the Fin de Siecle","author":"Elizabeth Carolyn Miller","publisher":"University of Michigan Press and University of Michigan Library","id":29,"isbn":"9780472024469"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2130,"display_name":"Benjamin, Walter"},"id":24145,"ring_next":6150,"ring_prev":6004},{"basket":{"id":7499,"display_name":"Bertillon, Alphonse"},"id":24157,"ring_next":5988,"ring_prev":6008},{"basket":{"id":7557,"display_name":"commodity fetishism"},"id":24343,"ring_next":6155,"ring_prev":6069},{"basket":{"id":7565,"display_name":"consumerism / consumer culture"},"id":24418,"ring_next":6095,"ring_prev":6079},{"basket":{"id":7576,"display_name":"criminology"},"id":24512,"ring_next":6090,"ring_prev":6071},{"basket":{"id":7593,"display_name":"department stores"},"id":24589,"ring_next":6097,"ring_prev":6056},{"basket":{"id":7632,"display_name":"Doyle, Arthur Conan -- Sherlock Holmes"},"id":24789,"ring_next":6088,"ring_prev":6066},{"basket":{"id":7651,"display_name":"Ellis, Havelock"},"id":24892,"ring_next":6099,"ring_prev":6065},{"basket":{"id":7709,"display_name":"Galton, Francis"},"id":25159,"ring_next":5988,"ring_prev":6066},{"basket":{"id":7726,"display_name":"Gunning, Tom"},"id":25207,"ring_next":6204,"ring_prev":6078},{"basket":{"id":7785,"display_name":"Lombroso, Cesare"},"id":25548,"ring_next":6099,"ring_prev":6065},{"basket":{"id":6219,"display_name":"Marx, Karl"},"id":25605,"ring_next":6222,"ring_prev":5412},{"basket":{"id":7882,"display_name":"passante"},"id":25899,"ring_next":6189,"ring_prev":6082},{"basket":{"id":7967,"display_name":"Subject for a Rogues' Gallery, A (1904)"},"id":26451,"ring_next":5985,"ring_prev":5985},{"basket":{"id":7991,"display_name":"United States -- U.S. films / film industry"},"id":26630,"ring_next":6108,"ring_prev":6081}],"localid":"page_110","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/12_chap03.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_110\">","css_selector":"#page_110","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_110\"]"},"next_location_id":6085,"previous_location_id":6083}]
