[{"id":23815,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"86-page_127","content_descriptor":"page 127","text":"Holland points out that Sandra, in another personal response, imagines Emily’s relation to Homer (though it turns out badly) as a useful alliance. Sandra has fearfully fantasized about Emily’s father, and this threatens her. Sandra has also (as I mentioned earlier) generated a fantasy about her attraction to Homer. In response to these variously assembled fantasies, Sandra forms judgments about relationships among them. Holland points out that Sandra’s response to Homer and Emily shows a positive judgment of the relationship. “In effect, she was saying, [Holland remarks] getting close to Homer gave Emily the strength to defy her father.”40\nSandra does not say this overtly, but she moves toward this ideal because she desires it. And she desires it because it helps her manage both her attraction to Homer and her fear of her father. We should recognize here that Sandra, in moving toward her primitive idealization of human relationships, is formulating a model for investing and regulating the investment of libidinal investment. She is prompted to structure these investments in particular ways because she is responding to a particular text in her own way.\nThere are signifiers in the text attached to characters who play certain “signified” roles in conflictual relationships. As Sandra responds to these characters, projecting her emotions on them, they come alive for her in particular ways. The figures in the text function much like her own internal representations of people, and just as those internal representations structure her emotions, her projected grasp of character in the text contributes to her structuring of emotion.\nHolland’s representation of Sandra’s inner feelings—”In effect, she was saying, getting close to Homer gave Emily the strength to defy her father”—is not something that Sandra quite says. But if she were to say it, and it is easy to imagine the logic that would lead her to his claim, this claim would be an example of an ideal produced by an interaction with a literary text. It is an ideal very much like the one made by Sebastian, who concludes, “I can feel more sympathetic with other old ladies.” And an ideal produced in this manner would be a powerful instance of rhetoric. It will be sensed as true and important because it helps Sandra manage her own fears and fantasies—not fears someone else has told her about, but fears that she herself lives, and senses diminishment in—precisely because her formulation of the ideal helps her to diminish them. The text contributes to her forming of this ideal, "},"document":{"title":"Narcissism and the Literary Libido","author":"Marshall W.
