To name the fears that help us perceive the ghosts, invisible to others yet clearly visible within the voices of our narrations, is the black woman writer’s primary task; using words, she sculpts our experience, claiming it, creating doorways through which the stench of blistering flesh cannot intrude. As she scratches the sickness of dehumanization onto paper, the writer transmutes the experience into powerful Nommo, defining, protecting, releasing the spirit necessary for transformation and survival in a world that does not include our voice.\nSome may argue that times and attitudes fostered by four centuries of institutionalized racism, sexism, and prejudice have changed in this country since slavery was abolished, or even within the last twenty years, since the civil rights movement and the antiwar movement of the 1970s.
