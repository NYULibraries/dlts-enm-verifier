The first part of the rule allows individuals to be excluded based on conduct alone. As with previous rules, it permits exceptions where the conduct is allegedly inconsistent with an individual’s orientation. As such, it retains the exception for the individual who is willing to disavow his or her same-sex sexual feelings or actions.\nThe second part of the rule is broader than past rules, because it allows for the exclusion of individuals based on speech, irrespective of a finding of any sexual activity. Under the old rules, the military had to presume a connection between speech and action (as in the benShalom case). Under the new rules, no such presumption is required. The mere statement that one is homosexual or bisexual apparently conflicts with military morale and is a ground for discharge. In addition, the second part of the rule provides explicitly for the exclusion of bisexuals. One does not have to label bisexuals as “homosexuals” in order to exclude them.\n"},"document":{"title":"Hybrid","author":"Ruth Colker","publisher":"New York University Press","id":43,"isbn":"9780814715383"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":15941,"display_name":"benShalom v.
