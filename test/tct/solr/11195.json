These words then remain the living bearers of unresolved memories. A second language may then assume superego qualities and help to repress early conflicts and incestuous feelings. By thus keeping oedipal conflicts in check, however, the new language maintains the individual’s unconscious fixation on the pregenital mother.\nFerenczi’s mother tongue was Hungarian, but he communicated with his mentor, Freud, in German, the language of the Austrian overlords. During Ferenczi’s childhood, moreover, Hungarian was not recognized as an official language in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and all instruction and political communication took place in German.\nIn view of this political context, I surmise that Ferenczi was caught between two languages—Hungarian, his mother tongue, a non-Indo-European language spoken only by the indigenous people and regarded as vulgar; and German, the paternal tongue of the rulers and the intellectual elite of the time. Freud, of course, invented psychoanalysis in German. According to G. A. Goldschmidt (1988), German “oriented” Freud, and psychoanalysis would not have been the same conceptually in another language.\nI wish to propose a hypothesis concerning the impact of this “bilingual splitting” on Ferenczi’s psychoanalytic thinking. Elsewhere (1992) I have tried to link the Hungarian language with the prescient concern of the Hungarian psychoanalytic school with the primary relationship between mother and child. I believe that Hungarian remained for Ferenczi the mother tongue in his relationship to Freud, that is, the language encapsulating early childhood conflicts as well as the lost pregenital mother. The isolation and repression of these conflicts was enhanced in his initial encounters with Freud, who served as a father-figure and spoke German, the language of authority.\nFerenczi’s early loss of his father when he himself was fifteen years old doubtless heightened his sensitivity to German as a Vatersprache, and the promise held out to him by analysis surely included the hope of strengthening an ego in danger of being taken over by an all-powerful Urmutter. For Ferenczi, as for Beckett (Casement 1982), the best way of separating from “mother” may have been to immerse himself in a foreign language.
