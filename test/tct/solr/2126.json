The model, as Olsen later summarized (2001, p. 193), “views organizational life as highly contextual, driven primarily by timing and coincidence.”\nThese scholars have since extended their work (e.g., March & Olsen, 1989, 1995) into larger institutional realms of governance, democracy, the military, and the nature of national, regional, and international political orders, promoting an approach known as the “new institutionalism.” A handful of media scholars have applied the new institutionalism to news production to explain phenomena such as content homogeneity across news organizations (Cook, 2006) and the sometimes surprising counterpoint, content variability (Ryfe, 2006).\nConcerns at the institutional level may eclipse quixotic explanations of decision making within single organizations, but the fundamental posture expressed in the garbage can model endures: human affairs are best understood not as outcomes of rational calculations and orderly processes but rather as historically contingent and socially emergent. From this perspective, distinctive socio-cultural understandings govern action, while socially constructed rules and practices themselves are continually molded through interactions and experience, and institutional structures are created, maintained, and transformed in interplay with multiple interests, changing resources, and twists of history.\nWith circumstances and serendipity as operative concepts, the garbage can model and its institutional augmentations are suggestive for the study of media, including comparative and transnational media research. The scheme originates from a certain kind of setting (fluid) with the presence of certain factors (choices, problems, solutions, participants), presenting identifiable, describable circumstances. And interactions among the key factors, producing not particularly efficient or sensible outcomes, are animated by serendipity—not pure chance or luck, but rather a mix that creates opportunity for those opportunely positioned (see Golin, 1957; also Zilber, Tuval-Mashiach, & Lieblich, 2008).\nCircumstances are “facts on the ground,” practices and routines, behaviors and actions, comportment and relationships, by and among agencies of human society, from individual actors to encompassing structures. They are the stuff of description, but also the basic ingredients of any social configuration. Serendipity, a term often found in accounts of scientific discovery, refers to how circumstances combine and interact in ways that agents\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2166,"display_name":"Comparative research (studies)"},"id":6677,"ring_next":2137,"ring_prev":2113},{"basket":{"id":1870,"display_name":"democracy"},"id":6834,"ring_next":2145,"ring_prev":2100},{"basket":{"id":2345,"display_name":"New institutionalism"},"id":7821,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_239","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter11.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_239\">","css_selector":"#page_239","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_239\"]"},"next_location_id":2127,"previous_location_id":2125}]
