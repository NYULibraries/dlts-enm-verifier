The novel attempts, on this evolutionary basis, to generate an alternate, new materialist and feminist biopolitics designed to permanently destabilize modern nationalist efforts to locate cultural origins and practices or biology outside time, and, equally, to trouble more recent neoliberal efforts to instrumentally direct material processes toward late capitalism’s immediate circulatory ends.\nThe novel’s turn to Darwinian evolutionary theory and more recent theories of genetic transmission, read in the context of twentieth-century American nationalisms and their virulent social Darwinisms, may initially seem surprising. Throughout Middlesex’s retrospective, historically detailed retracing of twentieth-century and early twenty-first-century nationalisms, there are numerous, extensive references to evolution, to evolutionary psychology, to sociobiology, as well as to the social Darwinism informing the Immigration Act of 1917, which blocked “undesirables” who, according to Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, “threatened ‘the very fabric of our race.’”30 It is fair to say that the novel is well aware of Darwinian theory’s previous engagements and evolutionary theory’s loaded political history. Middlesex takes up these prior evolutionary perspectives, recombines them with molecular genetics and the distinct evolutionary perspective on genetic transmission it opens onto, yet it does so to contest the hegemonic biopolitical circulations they are more frequently used to support. Instead, it remarks on the ongoing material processes unfolding through evolutionary time at multiple scales to open onto a distinct, alternate mode of linking material processes and cultural life to a biopolitics.\nThe novel’s reengagement of evolutionary, material history makes a bit more sense when considered in light of Elizabeth Grosz’s groundbreaking rethinking of Darwinian evolutionary theory and the latter’s conception of materially situated, yet dynamic, transformative time. In Time Travels: Feminism, Nature, Power, she argues that Darwin’s understanding of evolution as an “asystematic systematicity coextensive with all life” remains invaluable to contemporary feminisms and cultural theory.31 It provides a nuanced concept of life “as an opening up of matter to indeterminacy,” as a process that serves as “a bridge, a point of connection and transition between the biological and the cultural.”32 The novel’s, Grosz’s, and other new materialist rereadings of evolutionary theory more attuned to the complexities of Darwinian theory are especially needed in light of contemporary sociobiology’s and neoliberal bioinformatics’ frequent, reductive engagements with genetics and evolutionary theory, which are prone to reduplicate social Darwinist"},"document":{"title":"Tactics of the Human: Experimental Technics in American Fiction","author":"Shackelford, Laura","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":26,"isbn":"9780472120680"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":6559,"display_name":"Bioinformatics -- evolutionary time and becoming"},"id":21115,"ring_next":5470,"ring_prev":5365},{"basket":{"id":6598,"display_name":"Darwinian evolutionary theory -- social Darwinism"},"id":21282,"ring_next":5470,"ring_prev":5365},{"basket":{"id":6628,"display_name":"feminism and gender studies"},"id":21434,"ring_next":5478,"ring_prev":5446},{"basket":{"id":6644,"display_name":"Grosz, Elizabeth"},"id":21481,"ring_next":5468,"ring_prev":5457},{"basket":{"id":6645,"display_name":"Grosz, Elizabeth -- Time Travels"},"id":21484,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":6733,"display_name":"neoliberalism -- biopower"},"id":21831,"ring_next":5474,"ring_prev":5456},{"basket":{"id":6739,"display_name":"new materialism"},"id":21872,"ring_next":5465,"ring_prev":5403},{"basket":{"id":6747,"display_name":"\"ontologies of change\""},"id":21911,"ring_next":5367,"ring_prev":5457}],"localid":"page_186","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap005.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_186\">","css_selector":"#page_186","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_186\"]"},"next_location_id":5465,"previous_location_id":5463}]
