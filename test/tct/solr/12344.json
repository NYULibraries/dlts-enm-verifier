Chronic guilt seeks an object. In most Western countries, for example, the average middle-class masochist has to exercise some ingenuity, short of hiring a domi-natrix, stepping out onto a busy freeway, or committing a crime outright, in order to find punishment. In Russia, on the other hand, you don’t have to be very provocative at all. There’s always a line to stand in, a restaurant to refuse you admission, a bureaucrat to abuse you, an icon to bow before, a sin to repent for, a bathhouse to beat yourself in, an informer to report on you, an official who demands a bribe, and so on. Indeed, unless you are a privileged member of Russian society (e.g., you are included in the Soviet nomenklatura or its post-Soviet derivatives), it is very difficult to go about daily life without experiencing considerable pain. One might almost say that, in such a cultural environment, it helps to be a masochist.\nThis is precisely my point. In a country where the opportunities for experiencing guilt and suffering are legion there is strong psychological pressure on individuals to choose masochistic solutions to everyday problems. The Russian soul is a slave not only because certain psychological dynamics in early ontogeny universally favor the development of masochistic attitudes (they do), but also because cultural expectations and social organization in the adult world push the individual toward masochism.\nAmericans who go to Russia (either Soviet or post-Soviet) for an extended period of time like to say they are there “for the long haul.” Whatever their motives for being there, they do recognize that they are going to experience hardship and deprivation. Russians who come to the West, on the other hand, express no such sentiment about the West. They may miss their homeland, they may even disapprove of many aspects of life in the West, but I have never heard a Russian visitor or emigré say that life in the West is a hardship, or that they are in “for the long haul.”\nErgo, Russian society and culture must offer an overall greater opportunity for suffering than does the West. This is true regardless of whether any given individual who happens to be living in Russia actually "},"document":{"title":"The Slave Soul of Russia","author":"Daniel Rancour-Laferriere","publisher":"New York University Press","id":49,"isbn":"9780814774823"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":18993,"display_name":"bathhouse"},"id":51619,"ring_next":12348,"ring_prev":12511},{"basket":{"id":19432,"display_name":"nomenklatura"},"id":53241,"ring_next":13537,"ring_prev":12231},{"basket":{"id":19591,"display_name":"\"slave soul\""},"id":53832,"ring_next":12359,"ring_prev":12318}],"localid":"page_115","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch05.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_115\">","css_selector":"#page_115","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_115\"]"},"next_location_id":12345,"previous_location_id":12343}]
