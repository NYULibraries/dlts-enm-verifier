Peck,178 which was to be the first decision in which the Supreme Court held a state law violative of a provision of the federal Constitution,179 came before the Court from federal circuit courts.180 The Colder Court, in reviewing the decision of the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut, tacitly expressed not only the rule of Fletcher but also the power to review state court decisions,181 which would be promulgated by Story in Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee182 and Marshall in Cohens v. Virginia.183\nPaterson’s contribution to this important question was not limited to his participation in Colder, however. The power to review state court decisions on federal questions was conferred on the Supreme Court by the twenty-fifth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which Ellsworth and Paterson had coauthored.184 It was the validity of this section that was challenged and upheld in Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee and Cohens v. Virginia.\nThere were no opinions by Paterson among the three Supreme Court decisions rendered in 1799. In 1800, Paterson gave opinions in Cooper v. Telfair185 and Bas v. Tingy.186 In Cooper, it was contended that an act of the Georgia legislature that had confiscated Cooper’s estate for treason was an unconstitutional exercise of the judicial power by the legislature and also constituted a denial of the right to a trial by jury.187 The justices found nothing in the Georgia Constitution prohibiting the act, and Paterson added:\n[W]herever the legislative power of a government is undefined it includes the judicial and executive attributes. . . . [T]he power of confiscation and banishment ... is a power, that grows out of the very nature of the social compact, which must reside somewhere, and which is so inherent in the legislature, that it cannot be divested, or transferred, without an express provision of the constitution.188\nIn Bas, Congress had provided that if a ship should be recaptured from “the enemy” after being in the captor’s hands for more than ninety-six hours, one-half instead of one-eighth salvage would be earned.189 An American ship had been recaptured from the French under these conditions, but its owners claimed that France was not an “enemy” because war had not been declared.190 The justices, including Paterson, agreed in separate opinions that the limited hostilities authorized by Congress against France qualified her as an enemy and that therefore a “limited” war was being conducted at sea.191\n"},"document":{"title":"Seriatim","author":"John Marshall","publisher":"New York University Press","id":51,"isbn":"9780814731437"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":19761,"display_name":"Bas v.
