The agreement stipulates that each “country will send delegations of athletes, coaches and administrators to the other to share information about training and research.” China has signed such agreements with other countries as well, one article notes. In response to the agreement with the United States, Peter Ueberroth, chair of the United States Olympic Committee, is quoted as saying, “This agreement will benefit the athletes and coaches of each national Olympic committee, but it will also benefit the Olympic movement and sports” (Zinser 2006).\nYet another way in which China is constructed as conforming to global human rights practices is in its transformation concerning Sudan. China's stance toward Sudan changed in April 2007, the media narrative notes, when a senior Chinese official, Zhai Jun, recommended that Sudan allow a United Nations peacekeeping force to support the African Union's efforts in Sudan: “‘We suggest the Sudan side show flexibility and accept the United Nations peacekeepers,’ he urged.” The press note that he “even went all the way to Darfur and toured three refugee camps” (Cooper 2007).\nIn the space of equivocation, the tension that must be negotiated, according to the media narrative, is between conformity to global requirements for practices concerning human rights and maintenance of power and sovereignty, even at the expense of violating human rights. The media construction of China traditionally has featured the latter, but coverage in advance of the Olympics suggests a nascent effort to construct a different image of China—one that features some degree of conformity with human rights practices.\nSpace of Accumulation\nA third space created by the American media regarding China is a space of accumulation. A primary focus of American media coverage in the construction of this space is on the economic benefits the Olympics will bring. This theme is exemplified in a story that notes that the Chinese consider the number eight to be lucky because it rhymes with the Chinese character for wealth; because the Olympics means the possibility\n"},"document":{"title":"Owning the Olympics: Narratives of the New China","author":"Price, Monroe E.; Dayan, Daniel","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":9,"isbn":"9780472024506"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1868,"display_name":"Sudan"},"id":6091,"ring_next":1830,"ring_prev":1818}],"localid":"page_356","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/23_chap14.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_356\">","css_selector":"#page_356","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_356\"]"},"next_location_id":1822,"previous_location_id":1820}]
