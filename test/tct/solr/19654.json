Just get ‘em to come and help you and the more, you understand, more that you get, the more sisters that you can get, honey, the better it is for you. They’ll help you and by you being my main lady, you see, you don’t have that to worry about, see, ‘cause they ain’t going to never be able to take your place, you understand me? You bring ‘em home, I’ll do the rest.” And the cycle of loving her, seasoning her, and pimping her starts all over again.\nPolice Brutality\nThe last resort for escape is to go to the police. But this is hardly an option for women who know they are legally and morally condemned by those from whom they would seek help. Indeed, police brutality of prostitutes is periodically reported by women working the streets.\nOne night in March 1977 when Mary was working the streets to get enough money to pay her rent, she was solicited by an undercover police officer. When he identified himself as the police, she didn’t believe him. A rapist had been working the area and the prostitutes were quite anxious about who his next victim would be. She thought he was a trick who was going to take her someplace and beat her. Mary resisted arrest. When she tried to get out of the car, she was severely beaten. A nearby taxi driver noticing a man beating a woman, rushed to intervene, whereupon a backup police officer arrived and beat the taxi driver. Mary was taken to a police department’s holding tank, a room in a downtown hotel where each night police held prostitutes as they were arrested until there were enough to call for a paddy wagon to pick them up and take them to the police station.\nAnother prostitute was already in the holding tank when the officers arrived with Mary. She witnessed and later testified to the beating that Mary received in the hotel’s lower chambers.
