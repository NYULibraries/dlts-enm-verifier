It is the very diversity of the studio that makes the continuities of Shin Sang-ok’s corpus surprising and worthy of extended consideration. And indeed, a more careful consideration of this body of work reveals certain consistencies within the apparent miscellany. The generic range of Shin’s films, first, is somewhat more limited than customarily assumed, dominated in fact by the period-historical drama and the domestic melodrama, eclipsing the war film and entirely precluding the “youth” (ch’ŏngch’un) picture. The idiom, further, is overwhelmingly melodramatic, the codes of social conflict and affective excess animating nearly every film. And finally, the films are inhabited almost exclusively by a familiar set of faces—the contract players of the studio, led by Ch’oe Ŭn-hŭi and Sin Yŏng-gyun—that mobilize a stock dramatis personae—the middle-aged woman and the middle-aged man—that stage two central themes, the conflict between men and women and between the private and the public in the Confucian social order. To a certain extent these factors are conditioned by Shin’s overt entrepreneurial populism: the studio produced largely conventional melodramas about families for the lower- to middle-class middle-aged women who until the late 1960s made up the bulk of movie going audiences in the urban as well as the crucial rural markets. But they were also the narrative and affective structures through which Shin as a filmmaker, caught up in the pressures of mass production and, perhaps most important, his intimate links with the Park Chung Hee administration, could sustain a critical and creative conversation with the repressive domains of postwar Korean society and culture.\nStudio\nThe first few years of the 1960s saw political power in South Korea change hands twice, resting finally with the Park Chung Hee regime that would hold it in increasingly oppressive fashion until the dictator’s assassination in 1979.11 As we will see in more detail in the next chapter, the military coup staged by Park and his junta of officers aimed to sweep away what it saw as the moral and financial corruption, dependency, and stagnancy of the Syngman Rhee political world. Following an efficient and relatively bloodless purging of the old guard, the new administration, dubbed the Supreme Council for National Reconstruction (SCNR), fielded an army of technocrats and quickly drafted and implemented an extensive set of reforms under the “fatherland restoration” and “modernization” banners.
