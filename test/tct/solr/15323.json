Dresner, introduction to The Circle of the Baal Shem Tov: Studies in Hasidism, by Abraham Joshua Heschel, ed. and trans. Samuel H. Dresner (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1985).

In this regard, I agree with Jacob Neusner that American Jewish institutions tend to validate themselves in relation to Israel or to the Holocaust—to the exclusion of knowledge of the multifarious Jewish worlds before World War II, and to the exclusion of religious imperatives. See Jacob Neusner, Strangers at Home: “The Holocaust,” Zionism, and American Judaism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981); also Jacob Neusner, American Judaism: Adventure in Modernity (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1972).\n5.

It would have been misunderstood, in Western Europe, if he had signed his full Hasidic name, Abraham Joshua Heschel Heschel—or with the abridgment that became famous in the United States. (His three given names commemorate his great-great-grandfather, the Apter Rebbe, Abraham Joshua Heschel [1748–1825], known as the Ohev Yisrael, the Lover of Jews.) Neil Rosenstein, ed., The Unbroken Chain, 2 vols. (New York; CIS, 1990) is the basic reference work.\n11. Interview with Fritz A. Rothschild.
