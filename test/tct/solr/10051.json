Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him,” he offers his hand to lead Pip to his cabin. “Here, boy,” he says, “Ahab’s cabin shall be Pip’s home henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings.” And Pip responds, “What’s this? here’s velvet sharkskin” as he gazes at Ahab’s hand. “Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this, perhaps he had ne’er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the white, for I will not let this go.” Elsewhere another passage implies that a good grasp has as much meaning for Ahab as for Pip. As the carpenter fashions a new ivory leg for Ahab, the captain remarks, “This is a cogent vice thou hast here, carpenter; let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.” When the carpenter replies that the vice can break bones as well as hold them, Ahab answers, “No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery world that can hold.”\nImages of interpersonal connection such as “cords woven of my heartstrings” and the monkey-rope are not merely decorative metaphors. They have much the same kind of integral significance in the novel that the image of string does in a case described by Winnicott of a very disturbed seven-year-old who attempts to deal with his fear of separation, and to deny it, by using string and related images. The boy’s depressed mother cares for him until the birth of a sister when he is three years and three months old: “This was the first separation of importance, the next being at three years eleven months, when the mother had an operation. When the boy was four years nine months the mother went into a mental hospital for two months” (1971, 16). By this time the boy has begun to manifest a lot of anger and regression. When Winnicott engages him in a “squiggle game” (mutual drawing on paper that has diagnostic implications), he realizes that among ten of the drawings there are images of a lasso, a whip, a crop, a yo-yo string, a string in a knot, another crop, and another whip. When Winnicott points out this thematic redundancy to the parents, they mention having noticed that their son has been obsessed with anything and everything having to do with string, and having been worried when he had recently tied a string around his little sister’s neck! At Winnicott’s suggestion, the mother brings up the theme of string with her son. She finds him to be “eager to talk about his relation to her and "},"document":{"title":"Self and Other","author":"Robert Rogers","publisher":"New york University Press","id":41,"isbn":"9780814774434"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":15347,"display_name":"Attachment -- string as symbol of"},"id":44097,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":15663,"display_name":"Winnicott, W.
