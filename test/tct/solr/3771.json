When he asks, “Can I Kick It?” Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest calls out Lou Reed for both identifying the location of his “walk on the wild side” as New York City and including African American girls within that walk.38 Q-Tip questions Reed's ability to walk his streets or “hang” with A Tribe Called Quest. Although the lyrics do parody Lou Reed's, the group signifies on Reed primarily through the rhythm tracks and the melody. By reclaiming a stolen or bitten rhythm line, A Tribe Called Quest is engaged in a turf war with rock and roll. This battle is not about a physical space, but appropriated elements of intellectual property. Later in the song, Q-Tip asks David Dinkins, “Would you please be my mayor?” This references the election of the first black mayor of New York City and extends the parody and the claim of cultural ownership over New York City. A Tribe Called Quest calls out not only Lou Reed and rock and roll but the white political establishment that has attempted to dominate black urban spaces. “Can I Kick It?” simultaneously constitutes a parody of white popular culture and a demand for political and cultural freedom. The form of the music, although it shares some characteristics with Douglass's parody, also suggests a new use of signifyin’ in the post–Civil Rights era.\nSignifyin’ functions like a trademark or copyright symbol. A successful instance of signifyin’ constitutes an act of rhetorical ownership over an object, a text, or even an individual. For example, Douglass's parody demonstrated his moral superiority over Christian apologists through his verbal acuity, and A Tribe Called Quest asserts claims of cultural ownership over rock and roll and New York City. In both cases, African American cultural workers write over well-known texts. Signifyin’, especially in the case of hip-hop, adds an “ironic spin” on the original, frequently “contradicting the original meaning.”39 The practice of signifyin’ also refuses to acknowledge the seemingly settled distribution of property rights, which legal discourse purports to confer, and writes over them.40 Although Gates does not call attention to this explicitly, he describes how signifyin’ offers a method and a form to claim cultural and personal ownership over an object, sound, image, text, or trademarked logo. As a clandestine or alternative property-ownership system, signifyin’ allows participants within African American culture to write over an unjust distribution of intellectual and cultural resources. This competing legal structure “allocates” rights over intangible objects within African American culture without following the requirements identified in copyright or trademark law. For popular and vernacular culture, law, as written in the statute books, is simply irrelevant.
