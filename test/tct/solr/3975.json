I was fortunate in the guidance, advice, and encouragement generously extended by colleagues, friends, and family.\nAt the University of Michigan Press, I am grateful to Tom Dwyer, who helped shaped the manuscript from our earliest conversations. Series editor Mimi Ito suggested useful means of restructuring the flow of the book and provided sound advice about what to leave out as well as in. Heather Newman and Christopher Lehr produced images used in the book.\nAnonymous reviewers made invaluable suggestions on reworking critical arguments and improving the prose. Many, many thanks—you know who you are.\nI very much appreciate the feedback on various chapters provided by Trina Choontanom, Russell Crispin, Christopher Darrouzet-Nardi, Jeanette Darrouzet-Nardi, Scott Ditch, Alison Fish, He Jing, Yong Ming Kow, Wenjing Liang, Thomas Malaby, Linda Polin, and Celia Pearce.\nParticipants at the Productive Play Workshop hosted by Jason Ellis, Celia Pearce, and me at the University of California, Irvine, in May 2008, engaged in lively debate and discussion from which I profited.\nI thank the Intel Corporation, which, at the behest of Eleanor Wynn, provided funding for the research I conducted in China. The National Science Foundation funded a separate study in China conducted by my student Yong Ming Kow (grant no. 446680-21260), as well as sponsoring the Productive Play Workshop.\nI have many guildmates to thank—for good times as well as insights "},"document":{"title":"My Life as a Night Elf Priest","author":"Bonnie A.
