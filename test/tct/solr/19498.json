By 1967 more sexual explicitness was expected by consumers,10 which finally led to hard-core, violent, humiliating, degrading sex and the snuff films in which women were murdered in the sexual fix.\nToday male domination is sustained in large part by the failure of society to distinguish between sex that is exploitation and sex that is positive human experience, enhancing rather than destroying human lives. Feminism has intervened in the patriarchal construction of sex. In their civil rights approach to pornography, Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon redefined pornography to be “a systematic practice of exploitation and subordination based on sex which differentially harms women.”11 Dworkin and MacKinnon defined pornography as harm not only because it is violent—because it presents women being penetrated by objects or animals, because it presents women injured, bleeding, bruised in pornographic sex—but at its core pornography is violating because “women are presented as dehumanized sexual objects, things or commodities.”12\nLegally, Dworkin and MacKinnon have identified the subject matter of pornography as “graphic, sexually explicit presentation that produces a subordination of women through pictures and/or words” (emphasis added).
