Wikis are not a matter of “If you build it, they will come.” Though they may be profoundly technology-savvy, wikis may be unfamiliar to them. Build your own pages; ask them to edit, modify, and repurpose them. Show them Wikipedia; choose an article that needs editing and edit it for them on the screen. Explain the concept of wikispace; then encourage student buy-in by having them create small, informal group pages that others can add to and edit. Modeled guidance in wikispace can lead to an understanding of collaborative ethics and group rhetoric and can avoid free-for-all anarchy.\nLoosen up. This, of course, is the hardest thing for me to learn, after having been “in power” for more than twenty years. But Joe Moxley, M. C. Morgan, Matt Barton, and Donna Hanak state it best: in a wiki, “Textual authority is dialogical. Revision is privileged in the wiki. Each new reader can suddenly become a writer. The draft that matters is the last draft. Power and authority are given to the community rather than an individual or official staff.”9 Start now, then, to see how you will be able to let texts be altered on a daily, if not hourly, basis. Think of how you can encourage a kind of freedom to write, to tinker, to experiment.\nWould I do it again? You bet. Indeed, I am doing it again. This summer I am teaching the same online class but building it much differently. Students will still have separate places for some short assignments, but they will also have open spaces in which they will place and edit their papers. I'm working on a collaborative project to which they will all contribute, and, perhaps most important, we'll start the term with a discussion—in the wiki, of course—of collaboration, collaborative ethics, and the nature of the wiki space. Will it work? I don't know. The most important lesson that I find I will have to teach myself, though, is to remind myself constantly what I am doing and why I chose the technology in the first place. As I allow the technology to help me drive the pedagogy, it's more important than ever for me to pay attention to the technology. I am, however, much more confident now than I was a year ago. I've faced my praxis—perhaps the most difficult step—I've come to an accommodation on the issues of privacy (students will need to log on to the wiki but will have few other restrictions), and I'm (almost) ready to go. Like Jed Clampett, once I've gotten used to the issues and people in this new world, I hope to be a lot better able to navigate in it.\n"},"document":{"title":"Wiki Writing: Collaborative Learning in the College Classroom","author":"Cummings, Robert E.; Barton, Matt","publisher":"University of Michigan Press and University of Michigan Library","id":7,"isbn":"9780472024513"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_234","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/24_chap15.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_234\">","css_selector":"#page_234","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_234\"]"},"next_location_id":1438,"previous_location_id":1436}]
