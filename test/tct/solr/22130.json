See McConnell, “Originalism and the Desegregation Decisions,” 960, 997–98.\n27. Ibid.,, 969–71, 977–80.\n28. More evidence for this latter point is provided by Mark A. Graber, “A Constitutional Conspiracy Unmasked: Why ‘No State’ Does Not Mean ‘No State,’” Constitutional Commentary 10 (1993): 87–92.\n29. McConnell, “Originalism and the Desegregation Decisions,” 991, n. 194. In fairness, McConnell does not take full advantage of an argument that works in his behalf. In 1866, many radical Republicans argued that the Thirteenth Amendment’s enforcement section gave Congress broad power to address evils beyond the ban on chattel slavery that the first section of the amendment imposed. But the view that the enforcement section empowered Congress only to specify the remedies and penalties for the judicially cognizable ban was widespread, which was why many people thought the 1866 Civil Rights Act needed to be constitutionalized by a further amendment, as it then was. If we take the narrower view as having prevailed, then the enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment, when invoked on behalf of a school segregation ban in the 1870s, might well have been understood as an effort to provide further means of remedying and penalizing a practice already constitutionally banned in a way that was judicially cognizable. But since congressional views of the scope of such enforcement powers were divided, McConnell cannot claim that every vote for such a bill reflected a belief that segregation was constitutionally banned in a judicially enforceable fashion. Whether a majority had the view he claims thus remains unproven. For discussions of the enforcement power issue, see, for example, Harold M. Hyman and William M. Wiecek, Equal Justice under Law: Constitutional Development, 1835–1875 (New York: Harper & Row, 1982), 386–406.\n30. Whittington, “Constitutional Construction,” 426–41.\n31. McConnell, “Originalism and the Desegregation Decisions,” 1080–86. In a couple of places, McConnell responds to the Republicans’ abandonment of their quest to ban school segregation by quoting a desegregation supporter, James Monroe of Ohio, as saying that blacks in the South thought at that point that their “chances for good schools will be better under the Constitution with the protection of the courts” (1086, 1114). It is surely a sign of desperation when an effort to discern the intent of a majority of the overwhelmingly white framers and ratifiers in 1868 ends up appealing to the hopes of southern blacks in 1875. I fully accept those statements as better guides to justice and goodness, but not original intent.\n32.
