And expertise in sophisticated computer programming skills is not a prerequisite. All that is required is a commitment to, as contributor Stephen Ramsay observes in chapter 5 of this book, “community, relationship, and play.”\nAt the same time, I understood my colleague’s perspective. His response is not uncommon among humanists. In the second decade of the twenty-first century, we find ourselves in a research and teaching environment characterized by declining financial support and increasing use of technologies that were designed for business. A playful approach to teaching and learning with technology can seem like the worst of all possible worlds: the coupling of strategies developed for entertainment with tools created for commerce.\nThe contributors to this book have found themselves in situations similar to the one that I encountered at my presentation. We share our “non-digital” colleagues’ concern about losing practices centuries in the making, and their anxiety that the use of computing technology requires skill sets that they do not possess. The contributors to this volume came together to craft a response to those concerns at a symposium held in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Canada, in the spring of 2010. Funded by The History Education Network / Histoire et Éducation en Réseau and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,1 the gathering brought together academic historians, public historians, digital humanists, history educators, graduate students, and practicing teachers.\nWe recognized that our work forms part of a larger conversation about the future of the humanities. In his introduction to Switching Codes: Thinking Through Digital Technology in the Humanities and the Arts (an influential anthology of conversations among scholars, artists, and information technology specialists) editor Thomas Bartscherer observes:\n \nTo understand how digital technology is transforming thought and practice in the humanities and the arts, it is necessary to cultivate cross-cultural communication, to establish points of reference, and to develop a shared vocabulary. Given the globalized and decentralized nature of digital culture, this cannot be mandated from the top down, as it were, but must be cobbled together from the bottom up and on the fly. The intention here is not to compile an authoritative survey—truly a quixotic endeavour in such a rapidly changing landscape—but to model and catalyze a conversation.2\n \nThis is our aim too, with a focus on history in particular. We wrote Pastplay to create and sustain a conversation among historians and history educators across the spectrum of computational expertise.
