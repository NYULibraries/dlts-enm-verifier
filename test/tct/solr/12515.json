Selves should somehow be joined to others. This is already apparent in Chaadaev, it is especially clear in the Slavophile notion of the union of self and collective (e.g., Khomiakov’s sobornosf), it becomes “total unity” (“vsëedinstvo”) in Solov’ev, and appears as “multi-unity” or “all-unity” (“mnogoedinstvo,” “vseedinstvo”) in the works of Fedorov. George Young’s comments on this philosophical topic are quite pertinent: “In all these models, the individual is incomplete in and of itself. The individual completes himself, becomes whole, only by becoming part of a greater whole. Russian thinkers, like Russian composers, love the strong chorus” (Young 1979, 179). The “greater whole” that Young speaks of here implies an asymmetrical relationship with something lesser, i.e., the self as an isolated, insignificant individual. It is this obligatory lesser status, this acknowledgment of one’s own personal insignificance in the face of the all—that comprises the masochistic element in Russian mystical philosophy. One submits “freely,” says Solov’ev, i.e., masochistically. Even the great antimasochist Fedorov, who resists submission to death with such vehemence, and who rejects altruism as “slavery” and “self-destruction” (Fedorov 1906-13, vol. 2, 201), envisages a masochistic submission of the many to the all as the ideal alternative. Otherwise the “project” he proposes could not have been termed the “general task” (“obshchee delo”). Fedorov does not want the “blind force of nature” to coerce humankind, but his own writing is ultimately coercive, or conversely, it invites moral masochism in readers. Here it is ironic that Fedorov resisted making his writings generally available (“not for sale” is printed on the title page of the Vernyi edition). He must have sensed that widespread, popular acceptance of his ideas would have been uncomfortably close to acceptance of the “blind force of nature.”\n83. Berdiaev 1990, 297.\n84.
