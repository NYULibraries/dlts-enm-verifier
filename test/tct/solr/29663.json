Consequently, rather than a once-and-for-all census, “how many are we?” must constantly be re-posed, as the “we” in question changes with the circumstance at hand (indeed, it is the circumstance). For any new event, a new “we.” There is, Latour insists, always a “multiplicity of . . . new beings for which room must be made.”22\n        Whereas the first question is methodological and empirical, its objective descriptive rather than prescriptive (“It’s not a moral point”), the second—“can we live together?”—asks whether the newly recognized agencies thereby discovered can be reassembled into a rehabilitated (because no longer preformed or artificially exclusionary) society.23 “Once you have extended the range of entities,” Latour explains, “the new associations do not form a livable assemblage. This is where politics again enters the scene if we . . . define politics as the intuition that associations are not enough, that they should also be composed in order to design one common world.”24 In other words, once we have counted who “we” are, we must shape it in our preferred image and/or mold it to the task at hand. While acknowledging “the sheer difficulty of assembling collectives made of so many new members” (it’s why he insists on the initial separation of his two questions), Latour believes we can do so, even making such compositional efforts not only the right and necessary culmination of sociology but also “the only scientific and political cause worth living for.”25 Furthermore, in an age of ecological catastrophe (largely brought about by our refusal to acknowledge the networks of which we have always been a part), “we scarcely have much choice” but to make the world itself a matter of concern and the cosmos of things our partners in the endeavor.26 “We” must be universal. To fail to do so would mean that his reimagined House of Commons would fall, like the House of Usher, into the abyss between knowing the multiplicity of the cosmos and being able to act on it.\n        This wedding of an empirical imperative and a moral one raises two potential problems. The first is that Latour at least appears to suggest that the best way to reassemble the social is to quixotically extend the category of human subjectivity to “the parliament of things,” as when he claims that “other circulating entities have to be granted back "},"document":{"title":"Universes without Us","author":"Matthew A.
