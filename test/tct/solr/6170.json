At the time Wilde was writing, Marxist socialism was beginning to take root in Britain, but so were the ideas of anarchist socialists like Peter Kropotkin, whom Wilde admired. The anarchists were part of the First International coalition of socialist groups, but rather than advocating a powerful centralized state as Marxist socialists did (at least as an intermediary condition), anarchists envisioned a society of small, cooperative, communist collectives, based upon the principles of free choice and voluntary association. Far from wanting to centralize the state, they believed that the state, by exercising coercion, violates individuals' inherent right to freedom.19 The group had some overlap with the Individualist movement with which Guy associates Wilde: anarchists opposed private property (the lodestar of Individualism), but like the Individualists emphasized autonomy and personal liberty, believing bureaucracy and statecraft to be inherently corrupt.20\nWilde, as Eltis has shown, was quite attracted to the anarchist vision; as he said in an 1894 interview, “I think I am rather more than a Socialist. I am something of an Anarchist” (15). His regard for Kropotkin is widely documented, and in 1889, Wilde signed a public petition protesting the hanging of anarchists in Chicago's Haymarket fiasco, a risky decision for a man who wanted an audience, given mainstream animosity toward anarchism.21 Russian nihilism, like anarchism, was an antiauthoritarian political philosophy; Stepniak describes it as “a struggle for the emancipation of intelligence from every kind of dependence, [which] advanced side by side with that for the emancipation of the laboring classes from serfdom” (3–4). Considering Wilde's political tendencies, it is not surprising that his play is generally supportive of Russian nihilism, nor that Vera is a heroic figure. Not all of its nihilists are as admirable as Vera, but the play concurs with the nihilist position on czarist rule: it depicts the czarist regime in Russia as a stagnant, repressive despotism that devalues individual liberty. Russia's human rights abuses were notorious in nineteenth-century Europe; dissenters to the czar or his vast network of bureaucrats could be exiled to Siberia, without benefit of trial, merely for speaking out against the state. Vera does not offer a straightforward political program, yet is emphatically a play about the importance of individual liberties. It champions individualism as a salutary corrective to autocracy and as an avenue toward collective good. The play thus makes essentially the same individualist-socialist argument that Wilde made eight years later in “Soul of Man,” suggesting that his\n"},"document":{"title":"Framed: The New Woman Criminal in British Culture at the Fin de Siecle","author":"Elizabeth Carolyn Miller","publisher":"University of Michigan Press and University of Michigan Library","id":29,"isbn":"9780472024469"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":7476,"display_name":"anarchism / anarchists"},"id":24066,"ring_next":6180,"ring_prev":6164},{"basket":{"id":7548,"display_name":"class"},"id":24298,"ring_next":6172,"ring_prev":6149},{"basket":{"id":7771,"display_name":"Kropotkin, Peter"},"id":25485,"ring_next":6216,"ring_prev":14596},{"basket":{"id":7781,"display_name":"liberalism -- liberty of individual subject"},"id":25535,"ring_next":6182,"ring_prev":6157},{"basket":{"id":7802,"display_name":"Marxism / Marxist socialism"},"id":25614,"ring_next":6182,"ring_prev":6149},{"basket":{"id":7777,"display_name":"state, the"},"id":26350,"ring_next":6172,"ring_prev":6163},{"basket":{"id":7955,"display_name":"Stepniak"},"id":26359,"ring_next":6221,"ring_prev":6164},{"basket":{"id":7957,"display_name":"Stepniak -- Underground Russia"},"id":26367,"ring_next":6221,"ring_prev":6164}],"localid":"page_196","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/15_chap05.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_196\">","css_selector":"#page_196","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_196\"]"},"next_location_id":6171,"previous_location_id":6169}]
