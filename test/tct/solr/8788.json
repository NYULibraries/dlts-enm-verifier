In their more active and destructive aspect, these older women are also the witches who enchant the animal; as Bettelheim explains, since “our mothers—or nurses—were our earliest educators, it is likely that they first tabooed sex in some fashion; hence it is a female who turns the future groom into an animal.”53\nAn example of an older woman who teaches her daughter to repress sexual desires can be found when a young African girl is the paramour of a snake, whom she caresses with great enthusiasm until her female parent persuades her that he is dangerous.54 In an Eskimo story, a girl tends a snail in her bed, treating it in what she thinks is a maternal fashion until it grows to the proportions of a serpent. When she arrives at puberty, her mother becomes alarmed about this pet and arranges to kill it.55 A Haida tale involves a woman who “suckled a woodworm” until it grew to enormous proportions (a significant commingling of sexual and maternal themes); in this instance, however, the daughter is frustrated because her father will not give her in marriage.56 Such narratives explain why and how the repression occurs, not how it is to be undone. Mothers must be entrusted with the socialization of their daughters, and these mothers appear in the stories as themselves, not disguised as witches. Nor do they recede from the story to allow the relationship between the girl and her father to prevail, as—according to Bettelheim—she must transfer her affection from the parent who promises her to the beast (that is, arranges the marriage) to the beast itself.57\nBut in some variants, not the father but the mother—frequently driven by economic desperation—promises her daughter to a monster. In a Greek tale of a girl who marries an animal, there is, in fact, no mention of a father. Mother and daughter are enmeshed in tedious labor, and when the mother is delayed in gathering brushwood, her child eats an unbaked cake. In exasperation perhaps born of her essential helplessness, the mother utters the fateful curse: “Away with you, my daughter, and may the kerchief on your head fly away to the house of the ogres.”58 Neither is there mention of a father in the Chippewa story of a marriage to an ox, in which the mother of three girls is described as an old lady who gives her daughter to an animal to avoid eviction from the place they live. That the owner of the property is unknown may suggest an absent male figure intended to stand in for the father who fails to provide for the desperate four women.59 And, as a final example, "},"document":{"title":"In Search of the Swan Maiden","author":"Barbara Fass Leavy","publisher":"New York University Press","id":37,"isbn":"9780814751008"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":14293,"display_name":"Bettelheim, Bruno"},"id":41903,"ring_next":8803,"ring_prev":8787}],"localid":"page_114","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch04.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_114\">","css_selector":"#page_114","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_114\"]"},"next_location_id":8789,"previous_location_id":8787}]
