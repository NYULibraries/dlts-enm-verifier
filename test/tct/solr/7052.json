Hitwise tracks more than thirty thousand media sites, and those ranked below 500 account for more than a quarter of the total traffic. Collectively, lower-ranked outlets thus receive far more attention online than they do in any traditional media. The Internet, then, is hollowing out the audience for online news, shifting eyeballs to the most and least popular outlets at once.\nPartly, this counterintuitive result seems to come from exposing previously protected local monopolies to nationwide and even worldwide competition. The fate of online newspaper sites illustrates this problem starkly. Not only do the top ten newspapers get dramatically more of the total audience share online than in print, but it is overwhelmingly nationally prominent newspapers (e.g., the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the San Francisco Chronicle) that have a greater online market share; smaller newspapers, by contrast, have lost ground relative to their larger rivals. Controlling for potential confounding factors further strengthens this conclusion. Much content in local papers, for example, is provided by national and international wire services, such as the Associated Press or Reuters. Yet research by Paterson shows that here, too, online content provides less diversity than print media.40\nEven if online news outlets were a larger portion of the total content and even if top online news outlets were less influential, Benkler's account would still face problems. Most important, the political content that citizens are exposed to on the Internet is still provided overwhelmingly by the commercial mass media. Benkler is kinder to the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post— organizations that “may credibly claim to embody highly professional journalism”41 —than he is to local and regional newspapers. In this respect, shifts from local to national news outlets may be partly positive. Yet given how damning Benkler's critique of commercial media is, sending a proportionally larger number of eyeballs to the most popular news outlets does not seem like a step forward.\nThe content that Benkler is most interested in, then, is not news and media sites but the sites that Hitwise places in its “politics” category. Most of the specific examples that Benkler uses in his chapters on political freedom belong in this grouping. According to Hitwise, the politics category gets only 0.1 percent of total site traffic, less than one-thirtieth the traffic received by traditional news outlets.\nWe can argue all we want about what is going on with this one-tenth of 1 percent of all Internet traffic. But no matter how visibility within this\n"},"document":{"title":"The Hyperlinked Society: Questioning Connections in the Digital Age","author":"Turrow, Joseph; Tsui, Lokman","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":32,"isbn":"9780472024537"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":9790,"display_name":"New York"},"id":31385,"ring_next":7054,"ring_prev":7044},{"basket":{"id":826,"display_name":"The New York Times"},"id":31407,"ring_next":7054,"ring_prev":7044},{"basket":{"id":316,"display_name":"newspapers."},"id":31470,"ring_next":6785,"ring_prev":7033},{"basket":{"id":9828,"display_name":"Paterson, C."},"id":31530,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":8449,"display_name":"Reuters"},"id":31682,"ring_next":6287,"ring_prev":6901},{"basket":{"id":4996,"display_name":"The Wall Street Journal"},"id":31993,"ring_next":7054,"ring_prev":7038},{"basket":{"id":8563,"display_name":"The Washington Post"},"id":32005,"ring_next":7054,"ring_prev":7037}],"localid":"page_277","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap17.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_277\">","css_selector":"#page_277","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_277\"]"},"next_location_id":7053,"previous_location_id":7051}]
