This mode of shifting desire might well be more “fluid” than the other modes. Various objects of desire could successfully compete with each other, thus changing and redirecting desire, but such change would be cosmetic rather than essential.\n43. Freud distinguished between idealization and sublimation as follows:\nSublimation is a process that concerns object-libido and consists in the instinct’s directing itself toward an aim other than, and remote from, that of sexual satisfaction; in this process the accent falls upon deflection from sexuality. Idealization is a process that concerns the object; by it that object, without any alteration in its nature, is aggrandized or exalted in the subject’s mind. (Freud, “On Narcissism,” 94)\n44.

Skura, The Use of the Psychoanalytic Process, 12. Skura’s position breaks with traditional views of art that emphasize its childish quality. Artistic imagery, considered in traditional terms, is pure fantasy, something that satisfies childish desires in opposition to realistic modes of perception. Although Freud emphasizes the “sketchy” nature of his ruminations about artistic power, his authoritative influence on theorists has led to largely reductive forms of interpretation. For Freud’s followers, the symbol systems of a work “mean” the primitive narcissistic and defensive forces that produce them. The text, thus considered, merely represents repressed fantasy and “primary process” thinking—and nothing more.\n50. Sigmund Freud, “Formulations Regarding the Two Principles in Mental Functioning” (1911), The Standard Edition 12: 224.\n51. Rose, Trauma and Mastery in Life and Art, develops a very cogent argument about this.\n52. Traditional literary discussions of artistic images, in seeing significant positive resemblances between imagery and primitive thought processes, lend a certain intuitive support to my theory. T. S. Eliot, for example, acknowledges that “the artist is more primitive as well as more civilized” (essay of 1918 quoted by Rene Welleck and Austin Warren Theory of Literature[New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1956], 84). Welleck and Warren, discussing the psychology of the creative writer, observe that “some novelists may . . . have the capacity, common among children, but rare thereafter, of eidetic imagery” (83). They point out that another “primitive” feature found in a writer’s repertoire is “Synaesthesia, or the linking together of sensory perception out of two or more senses, most commonly hearing and sight. ...
