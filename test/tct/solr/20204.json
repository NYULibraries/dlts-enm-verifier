The prophet’s’sincerity derives from the abolition of personal motive, from abnegation, so that “one’s true nature” becomes synonymous with the divine message and one’s pathos with the divine pathos.\nEugene Debs was, by most accounts, successful in presenting a compelling sincerity to his audiences. Historical appraisals of him are unanimous in their assessment of his significance. Sidney Lens claims that, in his time, “Debs was the most idolized labor leader America had produced.”3 Described by Charles Madison as “one of the best platform speakers of his time,”4 Debs was, by most accounts, “a speaker in the great tradition of American public speaking.”5 Charles Lomas calls him “the most popular and effective orator” of the radical leaders of the day,6 and Bert Cochran states flatly, “There is no question that he [Debs] was the most popular and effective socialist figure ever to appear in America.”7 One of the few figures formidable enough to warrant individual mention in a broad survey of America in the Gilded Age, Debs is described by Richard L. McCormick as “an indigenous American radical” and “a brilliant orator.”8 Though Ronald Lee and James Andrews are inclined to’see in such assessments evidence of Debs’s latter-day rehabilitation by liberal historians,9 these encomia are based on and are completely consonant with those heard in Debs’s own time. However he may have failed as a reformer and politician, the record does not indicate that Debs’s ethos was ever in need of rehabilitation.\nEugene Debs and the Crisis of the New World\nThe crisis Debs addressed was the cataclysmic emergence of the modern world through the process we dispassionately label industrialism. In the fifty years following the Civil War, the United States was transformed from a preindustrial society of individual artisans, craftsmen, and yeoman farmers into the world’s preeminent industrial power.10 The change was pervasive; it left virtually no aspect of American life untouched, and its unrelenting newness was the source of “profound social and economic dislocations.”11\nRobert Wiebe has termed fin de siècle America “a society without a core”; it lacked the “national centers of authority and information” that might have given order to the changing world; there was no national community to replace the local communities that had been uprooted.12 For "},"document":{"title":"The Prophetic Tradition and Radical Rhetoric in America","author":"James Darsey","publisher":"New York University Press","id":75,"isbn":"9780814718766"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":30250,"display_name":"Andrews, James, on Debs"},"id":76813,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30377,"display_name":"Cochran, Bert, on Debs"},"id":77013,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30431,"display_name":"crisis -- in fin de siecle America"},"id":77095,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30660,"display_name":"industrialization in U.S."},"id":77479,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30726,"display_name":"Lee, Ronald, on Debs"},"id":77600,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30729,"display_name":"Lens, Sidney, on Debs"},"id":77604,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30747,"display_name":"logos -- related to pathos"},"id":77633,"ring_next":20143,"ring_prev":20197},{"basket":{"id":30749,"display_name":"Lomas, Charles, on Debs"},"id":77637,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30760,"display_name":"Madison, Charles, on Debs"},"id":77652,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30785,"display_name":"McCormick, Richard L., on Debs"},"id":77694,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":31151,"display_name":"Wiebe, Robert, on fin de siècle America"},"id":78295,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_86","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch05.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_86\">","css_selector":"#page_86","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_86\"]"},"next_location_id":20205,"previous_location_id":20203}]
