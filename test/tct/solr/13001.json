Only a few were able to make the journeys or the sophisticated arguments, or afford the lengthy apprenticeship, required of the General Court bar. “Fewer than twelve Virginians actually attended the Inns, received a call to the bar, and returned to actual legal practice before 1776,” and all, like Blair, became leaders of the General Court bar. Others rose from the petty gentry, such as Edmund Pendleton, George Wythe, Patrick Henry, and Thomas Jefferson. Blair was no spellbinding orator like Henry, nor deeply persuasive like Pendleton, being “without that ease in speech, which sometimes gives currency to dross,” but he was clear-minded, thorough, learned, and well connected, and he soon gained a respectable share of the business.6\nBlair also started to take his place in Virginia’s social and political order. He began a six-year stint as bursar of the College of William and Mary in 1760. He was selected as the college’s representative in the House of Burgesses in 1765, and, despite his very junior status, was chosen for important posts in 1766 and 1768. He was appointed Clerk of the Council in 1770 (resigning from Burgesses and leaving the active practice of law).

However, “[a]s events led to separation from Great Britain, Blair sided with those merchants and landowners who favored independence.” In May 1769 he presided over the House’s adoption of an address strongly condemning Parliament, and when the House was dissolved in 1769 and again in 1770, Blair joined with other merchant and planter leaders to draft the first nonimportation agreements. The dangers of an elite revolt, and the lie at the heart of American democracy, became momentarily apparent when, upon the sudden flight of the royal Governor Dunmore to his ships in May "},"document":{"title":"Seriatim","author":"John Marshall","publisher":"New York University Press","id":51,"isbn":"9780814731437"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":19927,"display_name":"Henry, Patrick"},"id":54613,"ring_next":13009,"ring_prev":12850},{"basket":{"id":13209,"display_name":"Jefferson, Thomas"},"id":54657,"ring_next":13016,"ring_prev":12889},{"basket":{"id":20079,"display_name":"Pendleton, Edmund"},"id":54918,"ring_next":13005,"ring_prev":14322},{"basket":{"id":20209,"display_name":"Wythe, George"},"id":55167,"ring_next":13168,"ring_prev":12863}],"localid":"page_157","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chapter6.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_157\">","css_selector":"#page_157","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_157\"]"},"next_location_id":13002,"previous_location_id":13000}]
