This need for extensive communication, as well as the need for outreach efforts to engage clients, results in a higher percentage of unbillable time than is typical in traditional programs. Our experience with the program has shown, however, that the model may result in cost savings. It has been effective in decreasing psychiatric emergency room visits among heavy users of such services and in engaging hard-to-reach clients, especially substance abusers, who had not been engaged by traditional programs. Given the growth of managed-care approaches, cost/benefit analyses of the advantages of nontraditional activities in reaching vulnerable populations will be essential to justifying this approach.\n\nRecommendations for Future Practice\nProviding mental health services integrated with primary medical care will be an effective way of delivering mental health services in the future, not only for the urban poor with HIV but also as a model for health service delivery in general. The model has implications for four other areas of practice:\n1. Other illnesses and other populations. Although integrated care improves access for the traditionally marginalized, many middle-class patients with diseases other than HIV also define themselves as “sick, not crazy” and are emotionally distanced from accessing the mental health services they may need. Any major illness can be emotionally overwhelming. The necessity to choose among an array of complex and technical treatment options increases the stress. If mental health can be defined as one of a spectrum of services available to any patient, more of the people who need such services will receive them.\n2. Freestanding mental health services. Integration with primary medical care may be easier for hospital-based mental health clinics than for freestanding facilities, but this model has implications for freestanding clinics as well. In an era of managed care, even free-standing clinics increasingly will have affiliations with medical facilities. These affiliations can become opportunities to integrate services and not just to expand referral networks. Freestanding facilities should consider providing some services onsite at affiliated agencies and allotting some staff time to communicate "},"document":{"title":"HIV Mental Health for the 21st Century","author":"Mark G.
