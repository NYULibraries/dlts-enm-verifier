It is so much more comfortable to divert one’s gaze.”81\nAlbert Vorspan, an official of the Reform movement’s Union of American Hebrew Congregations, attacked those he believed were considering withdrawing from the civil rights movement because of Black anti-Semitism. Vorspan wrote, “We are not in the fight for human rights because we want Negroes to like us . . . but because it is our task as Americans, our religious imperative as Jews, and our duty as human beings.”82\nSome Jewish race militants argued that the anti-Semitism of the Black Muslims was not as bad as white anti-Semitism and did not hold Blacks responsible for the kinds of attitudes they held. Often, it was explained, Black anti-Semitism was merely a reaction to white racism or economic circumstances. Along these lines, Rabbi Kurt Flascher differentiated the Black Muslim anti-Semitism from that of white right-wing anti-Semites like George Lincoln Rockwell. “We differentiate between an out-and-out anti-Semite like Rockwell, whose entire program is to preach the extermination of the Jews, period, and the Black Muslims, which is essentially a reaction to the racism and the terror and the brutalities to which the Negro people are exposed.”83\nMorris Schappes, the long-time radical and editor of the Marxist-oriented Jewish Currents, also expressed understanding for the racism and anti-Semitism of the Muslims, saying that it was similar to Jewish prejudice against non-Jews arising from the history of anti-Semitism. “I can understand the Black Muslims’ attitude and feeling, because I think it arises from the same frustration and fear,” wrote Schappes.84\nAt the 1964 convention of the American Jewish Congress, Shad Polier, an AJC official, reiterated his belief that Black anti-Semitism was essentially the result of a search for scapegoats, but he added that he did not believe that it or Black nationalism was “pervasive or enduring.” What concerned Polier most was that Jews might respond by leaving the struggle for civil rights. “What concerns me, as a Jew,” Polier said, “is not so much the phenomenon of Negro anti-Semitism but the response of the Jew to that phenomenon. It is all too easy and natural for the response to be one of resentment, fear, and hostility. . . . I am concerned lest these things happen to the Jew.” Polier said he had faith that this would not happen because “the Jew will not betray his heritage.”85 At the same meeting, Stanley Lowell, chairman of the New York City Commission on Human Rights, also reproached Jews who would shirk their responsibilities in the struggle "},"document":{"title":"Blacks in the Jewish Mind","author":"Seth Forman","publisher":"New York University Press","id":83,"isbn":"9780814726815"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":23293,"display_name":"American Jewish Congress"},"id":84977,"ring_next":22790,"ring_prev":22690},{"basket":{"id":33849,"display_name":"Anti-Semitism -- Jewish response to"},"id":85002,"ring_next":22781,"ring_prev":22813},{"basket":{"id":33890,"display_name":"Black Muslims"},"id":85083,"ring_next":22699,"ring_prev":22688},{"basket":{"id":34020,"display_name":"Flascher, Kurt"},"id":85327,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":34124,"display_name":"Jewish Currents"},"id":85522,"ring_next":22781,"ring_prev":22781},{"basket":{"id":34197,"display_name":"Lowell, Stanley"},"id":85656,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":34297,"display_name":"Polier, Shad"},"id":85841,"ring_next":22656,"ring_prev":22656},{"basket":{"id":34314,"display_name":"Racism -- Jewish"},"id":85871,"ring_next":22693,"ring_prev":22630},{"basket":{"id":34330,"display_name":"Rockwell, George Lincoln"},"id":85899,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":34409,"display_name":"Union of American Hebrew Congregations -- Committee on Social Action"},"id":86034,"ring_next":22662,"ring_prev":22662},{"basket":{"id":34417,"display_name":"Vorspan, Albert"},"id":86045,"ring_next":22795,"ring_prev":22668}],"localid":"page_74","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch02.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_74\">","css_selector":"#page_74","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_74\"]"},"next_location_id":22693,"previous_location_id":22691}]
