Certainly royal overreaching continued to be the subject of great bitterness and recrimination and even rebellion; the French Revolution itself was preceded by years of complaint by various propertied classes about royal inroads on their entitlements and “liberties.”37\nB. American “Republicanism” and Property\nIn America, a version of property-as-propriety can be located in a historic political mentality that is now much discussed, namely “civic republicanism.” Republican property was not so hierarchical as monarchic property, because it was thought that in a republic, the people rule themselves, and as a consequence a much broader range of citizens needed to have property.
