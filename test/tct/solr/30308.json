And finally, in the incipience of an independent fashion industry, and indeed before the material accessibility of couture, these films perform as venues for the consumption of modern fashions, and the worldly personae and affluence they suggest. Fashionable women are a central component of the fetish—for the foreign, for the refined, for the modern—that operates at the very surface of these films.\nFetishism, or at least a sort of lurid fascination, is also conducted compellingly in the relentlessly modern and often opulent commodities and spaces that are screened in these films. In fact, the visual field here is rarely colored by anything resembling the premodern. Only in Tongsimch’o, built as it is around the theme of conflict between the old and the new, does an old hanok enter the frame. But even in that film, the “traditional” is caught inescapably in the modern: the grand house is the object of an anonymous economic transaction (when an uninvited outsider moves to buy it from underneath the family), and the resplendent hanbok worn by the wealthy women are cut and patterned in a self-consciously modern style and accessorized with diamond jewelry and smart leather handbags. The consumption and use of new luxury products—a glass of expensive whiskey, Western clothes and baubles, gleaming foreign cars, and even Lassie-esque dogs—are pulled to the surface of the films via close framing, overt spotlighting, or by the sheer uncanniness of their presence. Much of the action also takes place in fresh settings: a new, compartmentally organized office building, alien law offices, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a multistory Chinese restaurant with private rooms, slick cafés (both popular and elite), and, notably, public parks and boulevards. But the most emblematic structure is the modern house, poised in virtually every film as the seat of social privilege and modern life. In Confessions of a College Girl, Senator Kim’s mansion is an imposing, ivy-covered structure abstracted from its surroundings.33 It is the home of political power, and so appropriately dark and aloof, its interior reminiscent of Victorian opulence more than postwar modernism. But it is also the site of a renovation in social relations, for the senator will soon welcome Sŏk-hŭi into his family as his daughter, despite the fact that she has lied about her blood ties. New dimensions of the house—a heavily trafficked foyer, a communal dining room, and Sŏk-hŭi’s sprawling private bedroom—structure the relations of the modern family. The house featured in It’s Not Her Sin is also an imposing structure, similarly cordoned off by a high iron fence, indicating the rarified domain of the well-traveled and seemingly flexible social elite. The entry is attended by a young housemaid, "},"document":{"title":"Split Screen Korea","author":"Steven Chung","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","id":110,"isbn":"9781452941516"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":5609,"display_name":"commodification"},"id":112055,"ring_next":30398,"ring_prev":30294},{"basket":{"id":44868,"display_name":"Confessions of a College Girl (film, Shin)"},"id":112066,"ring_next":30313,"ring_prev":30306},{"basket":{"id":44943,"display_name":"fetishism"},"id":112346,"ring_next":30310,"ring_prev":30360},{"basket":{"id":7692,"display_name":"film -- film noir"},"id":112474,"ring_next":6043,"ring_prev":30290},{"basket":{"id":44986,"display_name":"hanbok (Korean dress)"},"id":112524,"ring_next":30286,"ring_prev":30300},{"basket":{"id":45033,"display_name":"It's Not Her Sin (film, Shin)"},"id":112689,"ring_next":30314,"ring_prev":30306},{"basket":{"id":4803,"display_name":"spaces"},"id":113726,"ring_next":30312,"ring_prev":3435},{"basket":{"id":45308,"display_name":"Tongsimch'o (film, Shin)"},"id":113796,"ring_next":30311,"ring_prev":30307}],"localid":"page_70","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/xhtml/chapter2.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"pg_70\"/>","css_selector":"#pg_70","xpath":"a[@id=\"pg_70\"]"},"next_location_id":30309,"previous_location_id":30307}]
