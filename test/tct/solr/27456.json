On the one hand, scientists are able to pursue their profession free of government censorship. On the other hand, scientists receive generous government support.\nThe Tension between Freedom and Funding\nThere is, however, an important tension in this constitutional framework. In giving out its money to scientists, the government necessarily chooses among competing applicants. Those who lose out are free to pursue their research, but their freedom may often be theoretical, given the costs of research and the federal dominance in funding that research.\nObviously science is treated differently in our constitutional system than religion, because the First Amendment bars government funding of the latter. But the special status of science under our constitution is best illustrated by contrasting it with the status of the arts and politics. Literature and the arts are usually described as enjoying the same First Amendment protection as science, the Supreme Court having held that the First Amendment protects “serious literary, artistic, political [and] scientific” works.123 Actually, science may fare better when we recall, for example, that novels by Edmund Wilson and Henry Miller have been banned under varying tests of obscenity, whereas sex manuals of rather limited importance have long been protected because they fall into the category of science.124\nThe greatest contrast, however, between science and the arts appears in the relationship between freedom and funding. Federal spending for the arts lacks the built-in impetus of the military and standards clauses, as well as the historical association of science spending with the general welfare. Thus government spending for the arts, although constitutional, has remained quite low, and, even with recent increases, is a tiny fraction of spending for science.125 Yet even with support for the arts at such a low level, many artists (not to mention politicians) believe that government funding raises troubling questions concerning government domination of the artistic impulse and government support for “popular” rather than “elite” artistic endeavors.126 By contrast, scientists are relatively comfortable with their status as recipients of federal largess despite the far more intimate relationship between government and science. Questions are raised about whether the right scientists are receiving "},"document":{"title":"Culture Clash","author":"Steven Goldberg","publisher":"New York University Press","id":97,"isbn":"9780814730911"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":40801,"display_name":"Free speech -- tension with government funding"},"id":100057,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":40817,"display_name":"Funding of scientific research -- tension with free speech"},"id":100076,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_39","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch03.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_39\">","css_selector":"#page_39","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_39\"]"},"next_location_id":27457,"previous_location_id":27455}]
