It is known that in some societies, women and men literally speak different languages, and that in some cultures, folklore genres themselves are divided between the sexes, men relating tales in verse, women in prose, for example.46 But even when men and women speak the same language, this in itself is not “sufficient evidence that both sexes stand in the same relationship to that language.”47 And it remains possible that some female narrators may have so thoroughly internalized male views of reality that they transmit them as if they were the only possible views.\nIngrid Bengis has written eloquently about the impossibility for women to separate themselves from considerations of their role as women:\nAll men’s understanding of the “female condition” is separated from the condition itself, separated from the daily monotonous and repetitious occurrences which reinforce that condition. And as soon as they stop talking to the woman they “understand,” they are able to go about their business thinking about something other than the condition of women, whereas the moment I attempt to go about my business, I am obstructed in some way and am forced to deal with that condition simply because I am a woman.48\nIf it has indeed always been true that even in woman’s seemingly exclusive space, her otherness and relationship to man cannot be evaded in any self-awareness, then this might explain the narrative phenomenon Holbek reveals about the Danish tales he has studied: that men tell stories with male protagonists, whereas women tell stories with both female and male protagonists.49 In the next chapter the question will be raised of whether the focus of interest in the swan maiden’s tale is on the captured wife or on the husband who, having lost her, undertakes the search to bring her back to his world. Unfortunately, most variants came into print without any knowledge of the storyteller, without the kind of biographical information supplied about Clementina Todesco. It will, nonetheless, be possible to make generalizations about how the story’s basic outlines would appeal differently to male and female interests—both as constituted in the world and as imagined in fantasy.\nLady Drower’s consciousness of being a woman and of how her otherness in male-dominated Iraq benefited her endeavors as a folklorist coincides with her very attempt to go beyond the role of a woman as British and Iraqi society would define it (if to varying degrees). She is very explicit on this point. But she does not extend such self-consciousness to a consideration of how her very collection of stories—her choices "},"document":{"title":"In Search of the Swan Maiden","author":"Barbara Fass Leavy","publisher":"New York University Press","id":37,"isbn":"9780814751008"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":14289,"display_name":"Bengis, Ingrid"},"id":41887,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":14362,"display_name":"Gardner-Medwin, Alisoun"},"id":42113,"ring_next":9004,"ring_prev":9004},{"basket":{"id":14390,"display_name":"Holbek, Bengt"},"id":42171,"ring_next":8704,"ring_prev":8695}],"localid":"page_23","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch01.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_23\">","css_selector":"#page_23","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_23\"]"},"next_location_id":8698,"previous_location_id":8696}]
