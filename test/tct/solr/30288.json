Filmmaking and its extensive promotional apparatus became the best way to see the latest fashions, and fashion became a crucial means through which to emulate and embody the roles and fantasies films inspired. And it is precisely this mutual productivity that highlights the centrality of film and fashion to not only cultural but also political transformation. For, as many have noted, clothing functions as a key site in contests for power in the way, on the one hand, that it can enforce discipline (i.e., school and military uniforms), mark social class, and sediment gender roles and, on the other, signal political opposition and symbolize social nonconformity. Watching films and consuming fashions in Korea, then, can be read as practices that exemplified apathy and enabled hopeless social pretension but that also facilitated modes of thinking and inhabiting social space differently. This is partly an effect of the psychic identifications central to both fashion and film: as Kaja Silverman reminds us, for Freud, “the ego is ‘a mental projection of the surface of the body,’ and that surface is largely defined through dress.”1 But perhaps more critically, it stems from the disavowing temporality that Barthes persuasively argued is fashion’s defining feature: “As soon as the signified Fashion encounters a signifier (such and such a garment), the sign becomes the year’s Fashion, but thereby this Fashion dogmatically rejects the Fashion which preceded it, its own past; every new Fashion is a refusal to inherit, a subversion against the oppression of the preceding Fashion; Fashion experiences itself as a Right, the natural right of the present over the past.”2 This willed amnesia and ephemerality, as I will attempt to argue below, belies the very historicity of the images of refinement and polish that dominate visual mass cultures of the 1950s.\nBeginnings\nShin Sang-ok’s 1958 Hellflower (Chiok’hwa) opens with an arresting visualization of postwar Seoul. Tong-sik is just up from the country and lost in the chaos of the cars and people blurring past the train station. He has come to find his prodigal older brother, but his bag is promptly stolen by grim-faced thugs and he is left to wander aimlessly. The scene is intercut with stark documentary footage of dusty streets, crowded markets, and strolling American soldiers, announcing the film’s neorealist style. When the camera turns to Tong-sik, it frames him in low angles and long field depth, embedding his humble figure in a faceless, featureless urban space. He somehow manages to spot his brother, Yŏng-sik, and calls out to him, but his brother, in fashionable fedora and flowing linen suit, inexplicably runs off and melts into "},"document":{"title":"Split Screen Korea","author":"Steven Chung","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","id":110,"isbn":"9781452941516"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":35242,"display_name":"Barthes, Roland"},"id":111863,"ring_next":30612,"ring_prev":30285},{"basket":{"id":44996,"display_name":"Hellflower (film, Shin)"},"id":112549,"ring_next":30291,"ring_prev":30454},{"basket":{"id":7581,"display_name":"mass culture"},"id":112889,"ring_next":30305,"ring_prev":30287},{"basket":{"id":45139,"display_name":"neorealist films"},"id":113100,"ring_next":30306,"ring_prev":30263},{"basket":{"id":45145,"display_name":"1950s -- Shin's work during"},"id":113117,"ring_next":30294,"ring_prev":30255},{"basket":{"id":45234,"display_name":"Seoul, South Korea"},"id":113499,"ring_next":30318,"ring_prev":30388},{"basket":{"id":32025,"display_name":"Silverman, Kaja"},"id":113657,"ring_next":21178,"ring_prev":24528},{"basket":{"id":6322,"display_name":"temporality"},"id":113764,"ring_next":30410,"ring_prev":30248},{"basket":{"id":45332,"display_name":"women's melodramas -- in 1950s"},"id":113890,"ring_next":30338,"ring_prev":30339}],"localid":"page_50","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/xhtml/chapter2.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"pg_50\"/>","css_selector":"#pg_50","xpath":"a[@id=\"pg_50\"]"},"next_location_id":30289,"previous_location_id":30287}]
