This chapter examines two major mechanisms of professionalizing Digital Humanities: the formation of communities of practice and scholarly publication.\nCommunities of Practice\nThe radical version of interdisciplinarity holds that nothing less than jettisoning the structure of disciplinarity will result in significant change. Yet, in an essay on “The Politics of Disciplinary Advantage,” Rodgers, Booth, and Eveline admit that countertactics can never completely overthrow disciplinary hegemony. They advocate getting around rules of constraint by controlling boundaries, establishing methodological and theoretical rigor, formulating recommendations for practice, and creating a self-regulating guild. Through these actions, individuals and groups negotiate the material and representational economy in which interdisciplinarity is deployed, moving within and across disciplinary structure in order to transcend it and thereby “making a difference.” Communities of practice are one of the most important means of doing so. The term is associated with Lave and Wenger’s studies of craft- and skill-based activities. They examined apprenticeships of midwives, native tailors, navy quartermasters, and meat cutters, though subsequently the concept was adapted in other areas including education, knowledge management, and studies of online communities. The central idea is that people who share a common interest, craft, or profession generate community, establishing common ground through sharing information and experiences. As they learn from each other, they build a repertoire of common knowledge, communal resources, collaborative relationships, shared norms, and best practices (Situated Learning).\nThe repertoires that communities build form the basis for platforming a new field. In the world of computing, platform refers to hardware architecture or frameworks that allow software to run. Interdisciplinary fields are neither hardware nor software, but the social architecture for a networked operating system is vital to their strength and sustainability. John Unsworth’s description of the shift from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 provides a way of thinking about this concept. Emphasis shifted with Web 2.0 from\n"},"document":{"title":"Interdisciplining Digital Humanities: Boundary Work in an Emerging Field","author":"Klein, Julie Thompson","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":31,"isbn":"9780472120932"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":8655,"display_name":"Booth, Michael, \"The Politics of Disciplinary Advantage\""},"id":28912,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1610,"display_name":"communities of practice"},"id":29016,"ring_next":6664,"ring_prev":6577},{"basket":{"id":8860,"display_name":"Eveline, Joan, \"The Politics of Disciplinary Advantage\""},"id":29229,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":8986,"display_name":"interdisciplinarity (ID)"},"id":29434,"ring_next":6662,"ring_prev":6645},{"basket":{"id":8998,"display_name":"interdisciplinary, \ncommunity -- fields"},"id":29474,"ring_next":6661,"ring_prev":6643},{"basket":{"id":9200,"display_name":"platforms"},"id":29792,"ring_next":6659,"ring_prev":6628},{"basket":{"id":9220,"display_name":"professionalization -- communities of practice"},"id":29835,"ring_next":6664,"ring_prev":6664},{"basket":{"id":9242,"display_name":"Rodgers, Steve, \"The Politics of Disciplinary Advantage\""},"id":29879,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":9451,"display_name":"Unsworth, John"},"id":30190,"ring_next":6680,"ring_prev":6585},{"basket":{"id":9471,"display_name":"Web 1.0"},"id":30223,"ring_next":6670,"ring_prev":6608},{"basket":{"id":6341,"display_name":"Web 2.0"},"id":30226,"ring_next":6668,"ring_prev":6608}],"localid":"page_91","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter04.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_91\">","css_selector":"#page_91","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_91\"]"},"next_location_id":6659,"previous_location_id":6657}]
