(Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2010), Cary Wolfe argues that posthumanism must entail the troubling of both humanist form (the assumption that there is a natural, one-to-one correspondence between the representation and the represented) and humanist content (the taxonomic privileging of the human over the nonhuman).\n          \n          \n            88\tFor the relation of these movements and Africanist beliefs, see Anderson, Conjure, 140–42.\n          \n          \n            89\tAlthough this conception owes much to British romanticism, both Muir and Burroughs were inspired more directly by Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman. Indeed, Burroughs wrote the first biography on Whitman, Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person (1867). In the later Birds and Poets (the title resonating with Whitmanian echoes), he characteristically claimed that “the true poet knows more about Nature than the naturalists because he carries her open secrets in his heart.” http://wakerobin.org/.\n          \n          \n            90\tH.
