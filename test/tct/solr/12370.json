A variant form, “Fuck your mother!” (“Ebi tvoiu mat’!”) admonishes the addressee to commit incest—also a clearly Oedipal idea.\nThe Oedipal suggestiveness of mat is expressed by an explicitly Oedipal legend from the Smolensk area about its origin:\nEvery person has three mothers: his natal mother and two great mothers, moist mother earth and the Mother of God. The devil “disturbed” one person. This person killed his father and married his mother. From that time on humankind has been swearing, mentioning the name of the mother in curses, and from that time this evil has spread about the earth.24\nBoris Uspenskii cites numerous religious folkloric texts in which one’s own mother, mother earth, or the Mother of God is horrified and suffers greatly upon hearing mat spoken.25 An inescapable consequence of mat—at least in the fantasy life of the religious Russian—is maternal suffering. All of these texts are of course designed to induce guilt in the addressee. One should, like one’s mother, suffer.\nThis brings us to the pre-Oedipal aspect of Russian obscenities. When mat is used aggressively, the direct target (given in the accusative case) is the mother. But mat is always understood as being directed at the mother’s child as well. That is, to insult a person’s mother using mat is the same as to insult the person. The person’s honor depends on the mother’s honor. Why this should be so makes sense, psychoanalytically. After all, the person’s self-esteem or core narcissism itself derives from pre-Oedipal interaction with the mother. Indeed, it was during a period when the self was not yet clearly distinguished from the mother, when the boundary with her was not yet clearly established, that the child’s narcissistic core was formed. The insult “I fucked your mother” injures self-definition as much as it injures self-esteem.\nA common variation on “I fucked your mother” is “I fucked your soul-mother” (“Eb tvoiu dushu mat’ “). This adds a sacral or religious tone, as Uspenskii observes.26 But the extension is psychoanalytically revealing as well. The word “soul” stands in grammatical apposition to “mother” (they are both in the accusative case). Thus the soul as well as the mother are “fucked.” But the “soul” in question is that of the addressee, so the expletive’s target is equally the mother and the "},"document":{"title":"The Slave Soul of Russia","author":"Daniel Rancour-Laferriere","publisher":"New York University Press","id":49,"isbn":"9780814774823"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":19040,"display_name":"boundaries -- erasure of"},"id":51808,"ring_next":12375,"ring_prev":12362},{"basket":{"id":15462,"display_name":"guilt"},"id":52442,"ring_next":12387,"ring_prev":12349},{"basket":{"id":13326,"display_name":"narcissism"},"id":53193,"ring_next":12443,"ring_prev":12336},{"basket":{"id":19488,"display_name":"pre-Oedipal issues"},"id":53396,"ring_next":12421,"ring_prev":12349},{"basket":{"id":13151,"display_name":"Self -- esteem"},"id":53721,"ring_next":12389,"ring_prev":12336},{"basket":{"id":19668,"display_name":"Uspenskii, Boris"},"id":54132,"ring_next":12376,"ring_prev":12501}],"localid":"page_141","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch07.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_141\">","css_selector":"#page_141","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_141\"]"},"next_location_id":12371,"previous_location_id":12369}]
