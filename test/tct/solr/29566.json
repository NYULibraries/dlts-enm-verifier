Although DeLanda explicitly cautions that thermodynamic evolution neither can “be viewed as . . . [moving through] progressively more sophisticated stages . . . that culminat[e] in humanity as its crowning achievement” nor can “guarantee . . . a golden age ahead,” he nevertheless locates “a new kind of hope” in the “positive, even joyful” project of “destratify[ing] reality itself”—a project based in finding “the pragmatic uses of” thinking in terms of heterogeneous processes.57 In this, DeLanda is joined by Elizabeth Grosz, Keith Ansell Pearson, and numerous other theorists seeking to “reconceptualiz[e] the dynamics of political change and social and cultural upheaval” by basing them in “the unpredictable . . . [and] nondeterministic” events of temporal and material flux.58 By converting universal indeterminacy into a praxis of personal and collective liberation, they open new horizons of “endless becoming.”59 It is an idea, of course, that originates not in our age but in Adams’s, where Bergson, James, and others link the “creative evolution” of the cosmos—“the most intimate secre[t] of life”—to the revitalization of ourselves.60\n        Adams, however, refuses such comfort. Where others believe universal process to be inherently democratic, Adams sees only the "},"document":{"title":"Universes without Us","author":"Matthew A.
