The father of systems theory, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, insists that modern views of man have in common the principle “to take man not as a reactive automaton or robot but as an active personality system” (1968, 207), meaning, among other things, an open (as distinguished from closed), information-processing, dynamically self-regulating system. Peterfreund, whose application of systems theory to psychoanalysis remains the most comprehensive and valuable treatment, writes that “self, object, and superego representations are highly interrelated and interdependent; they form a vast system, and each part constandy feeds back information to every other part” (1971, 159). Rosenblatt and Thickstun say that the self system “can be conceptualized as the superordinate system, or the organism itself, encompassing all of the systems operating within the organism”(1977, 300). Bowlby, who embraces systems theory, tends to think in terms of groups of individuals rather than isolated ones, and he seems to be uncomfortable with person-oriented terms. He discusses the concept of self (1980, 59-64), yet makes litde use of it; there is, nevertheless, litde or nothing in his writing that conflicts with a systemic view of selfhood. Although Stern’s book on self theory (1985) does not explicidy refer to systems theory, nothing in his focus on epigenesis appears to be at odds with the systems model. Lichtenberg (1989), whose work derives partly from Stern and partly from self psychology, makes extensive use of the concept of system even though, methodologically, he does not appear to rely much on general systems theory as such. Lichtenberg, who defines “the self as an independent center for initiating, organizing, and integrating” (12), generates a schema of five distinct yet interactive motivational systems: a system regulating physiological requirements, an attachment-affiliation system, and exploratory-assertive system, an aversive system, and a sensual-sexual system. “As each system self-organizes and self-stabilizes, the needs that constitute the system’s core are met or fail to be met” (275). Basch represents the case for a systemic view of selfhood well when he writes, “The modern term psychodynamics can be understood as referring to the movement of goal-directed systems toward decisions. The process is measured by and expressed in terms of information. Thus is the once-mysterious psyche taken out of the realm of the supernatural to join science, the search for order in nature” (1988, 58).\nWhile alternative models of self will doubdess continue to be formulated, it seems almost inevitable that the more valuable ones will incorpo "},"document":{"title":"Self and Other","author":"Robert Rogers","publisher":"New york University Press","id":41,"isbn":"9780814774434"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":16867,"display_name":"Basch, Michael"},"id":44105,"ring_next":11294,"ring_prev":11294},{"basket":{"id":15358,"display_name":"Bertalanffy, L."},"id":44109,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":15518,"display_name":"Lichtenberg, J.
