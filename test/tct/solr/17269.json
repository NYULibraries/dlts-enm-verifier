In many instances, the dominant culture consigns the members of the subcultural group to a position beyond common decency, sometimes outside of humanity itself. From the perspective of members of the dominant culture, such objectification can seem to justify the most heinous emotional and physical abuses of the subcultural members (for, after all, they are barely human or even less than human). Most important, with either form of redefinition—denial of difference, or exclusion and objectification—the dominant culture attempts to define the subculture itself. The struggle between the dominant and subcultural discourses encompasses the very being and social identity of the subcultural group and its members.\nThis viewpoint partly reveals how Christian cultural domination has historically produced antisemitism. For most of the last two millennia, Christians have maintained a position of hegemonic domination in western society by, in part, implementing both forms of redefinition to subdue the threat of a Jewish subculture.22 To some extent, the difference between Christianity and Judaism lies in the meaning attributed to the life and death of Jesus: to Christians, but not to Jews, Jesus was the Messiah and the Son of God.23 Consequently, the New Testament, as Christian discourse (and dogma), seeks to subdue the threat of the Jewish counter-discourse—the Jewish refusal to accept the Christian meaning of Jesus. As discussed in chapter 2, the New Testament denies the Jewish difference by appropriating Jewish history and the Hebrew Bible (literally renamed as the Old Testament) to support the Christian interpretation of reality (the coming of Jesus as the Messiah). After Jesus’ death, his followers searched the Hebrew Bible for historical passages that they could interpret to show that Jesus’ life and death as the Messiah had been prophesied. They sought, in effect, to deny or negate the Jewish understanding of Judaic history in their effort to bolster the Christian interpretation of history as leading to Jesus as the Messiah. The New Testament, in short, attempts to (re)define Judaism itself to serve Christian purposes.\nFurthermore, the New Testament objectifies Jews and attempts to establish their inferiority. In particular, the New Testament opposes a world of Christian spirituality to a world of Judaic carnality. Indeed, according to Christian discourse, Jews refused to accept Jesus because, supposedly, they were from the Devil. Hence, the New Testament condemns the Jewish world yet nonetheless commands that Jews not be physically coerced into converting to Christianity. The New Testament narrative therefore expressly designates the Jews as deserving a fate of endless persecution and suffering—until they finally realize their blindness and truly come to believe that Jesus was Christ.\n"},"document":{"title":"Please don’t Wish me a Merry Christmas","author":"Stephen M.
