Multi-tasking on different media platforms and the 24/7 news circles challenge journalists not only in technical ways but force them to reconsider classic notions of balance, objectivity and bias (Thussu, 2008). This also accounts for the interpretation of concepts such as cultural and press freedom in, for instance, the post-communist world (Casmir, 1995; De Smaele, 1999; Jakubowicz, 2007), Asia (Iyer, 2001), Latin America (Beltran, 1993; Fox, 1988) or Islamic society (Hussain, 2006); a discussion on journalism ethics and universal versus particular values (Christians & Traber, 1997; Karikari, 1996; Preston, 2007; Ukpabi, 2001), journalism in a Buddhist (Dissanayake, 2006; Gunaratne, 2007) or Confucian/Chinese (Chen, 2004; Gunaratne, 2005) tradition; or deontological codes and practices in different parts of the world (Mendel, 2008; Pigeat & Huteau, 2000).\nChristians et al. (2009) identify four distinct yet overlapping roles for the media: the monitorial role of a vigilant informer collecting and publishing information of potential interest to the public; the facilitative role that not only reports on but also seeks to support and strengthen civil society; the radical role that challenges authority and voices support for reform; and the collaborative role that creates partnerships between journalists and centers of power in society, notably the state, to advance mutually acceptable interests. Each role could be associated with a specific set of competencies, which the journalist or knowledge worker of the future needs to acquire in order to perform adequately. In other words, competencies are characteristics that individuals have and use in appropriate, consistent ways in order to achieve a desired performance. These characteristics include knowledge, skills, aspects of self-image, social motives, thought patterns, mind-sets, and ways of thinking, feeling, and acting (Dubois & Rothwell, 2004; Irigoin et al., 2002; Hofstede & Hofstede, 2005). The journalistic competencies needed to operate in today’s complex world are manifold and are almost impossible to acquire during a regular journalism program. They range from core or generic competencies (e.g., communication, teamwork) to managerial competencies (e.g., empowering others, decision making) and technical or specialist competencies related to specific jobs within the journalism profession. In other words, a competency is measured by identifying the behaviors or tangible results (outcomes) produced by their use in the context of the work performed.\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2121,"display_name":"Asia"},"id":6333,"ring_next":1966,"ring_prev":1963},{"basket":{"id":2160,"display_name":"civil society"},"id":6591,"ring_next":1967,"ring_prev":1934},{"basket":{"id":277,"display_name":"globalization"},"id":7046,"ring_next":1966,"ring_prev":1955},{"basket":{"id":295,"display_name":"journalism"},"id":7403,"ring_next":1968,"ring_prev":1964},{"basket":{"id":297,"display_name":"Latin America"},"id":7454,"ring_next":2068,"ring_prev":1963},{"basket":{"id":2308,"display_name":"Media market"},"id":7589,"ring_next":1979,"ring_prev":1961},{"basket":{"id":2349,"display_name":"Normative theory (standard, vision, stance)"},"id":7851,"ring_next":1978,"ring_prev":1964},{"basket":{"id":2343,"display_name":"Social networks"},"id":8138,"ring_next":1980,"ring_prev":7049}],"localid":"page_78","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter04.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_78\">","css_selector":"#page_78","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_78\"]"},"next_location_id":1966,"previous_location_id":1964}]
