I am hot and tired, like I didn’t sleep a wink.”\n“But you did sleep. I don’t mind.” (Little black slippers, buckled above the instep. Like a child’s.)\n“You know, I feel better.” (Her feet, without her hands’ help, shed the shoes. One fell into a patch of clover by the step. It was, I imagined, happy as a shiny black pig in clover now.)\n“Now, those tight hot stockings,” I told her. (She peels her legs bare, revealing about five fresh-clotted razor cuts. Mistakenly, she shaved for me.)\n“Your dress unbuttons down the back. I’ll do it for you.”\n“Daisy sewed it.”\n“Who is Daisy?”\n“She is mine. My little girl, fifteen years old.” \n“Like you?”\n“Not like me. Nor Theophilus either.”\n“That’s wonderful.”\n“You want me to lift up a little? Then you can slip it over my head.”\n“That’s what I want you to do. I’ll take the petticoat at the same time.” (Draping both across the boxwood, as though she were going swimming.)\n“To save the awkwardness, I’ll lift you and carry you into my house.

Like you.”\n"},"document":{"title":"Lover","author":"Bertha Harris","publisher":"New York University Press","id":77,"isbn":"9780814735053"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_59","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chapter1.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_59\">","css_selector":"#page_59","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_59\"]"},"next_location_id":20849,"previous_location_id":20847}]
