Yet this observation sat awkwardly with principles of natural selection that specified that evolution occurs because “the best adapted individuals … tend to propagate their kind in larger numbers than the less well adapted” (152). Giving aid to others may well benefit collective survival. But it appears to be individually maladaptive to help reproductive “competitors” at the cost of threatening one’s personal capacity to survive and propagate one’s own genes.\nSo how could initially rare mutations favoring altruism ever have been spread and sustained through natural selection? Surely, selfish individuals who merely accepted the altruism of others would thrive and be more reproductively successful? This may be called the biological paradox of altruism. Darwin had no clear, consistent, comprehensive answer to it, and the issue was fudged for a century. Pseudosolutions relied upon the assumption that selection favors the survival of whole breeding groups, or the “good of the species.” But once the conceptual and empirical inadequacies of “group selection” began to be exposed (e.g., Maynard Smith 1964), a revised explanatory framework for the evolution of social life was necessary. Wilson’s (1975) overenthusiasm for new biological concepts that could explain self-sacrificial behaviors was understandable. But like Dawkins (The Selfish Gene, 1976), he was essentially an interpreter of sociobiology’s basic theories. One central problem in applying these to humans was that biologists untrained in psychology readily confounded costly consequences of altruism with questions about its motivating causes, including intentional concern for others’ needs and interests. Thus a realistic assessment of human altruism must start with what the core theories do strictly imply about our species.\nThe general evolutionary puzzle is real enough. Adaptively critical traits like readily risking one’s life on another’s behalf are too widespread in nature to be trivial anomalies. It seems that they should be strongly opposed by natural selection—especially in any species whose behavior is rigidly shaped by genetically specified “instinct” mechanisms. Yet Darwin saw that some evolutionary lines had specialized in parental care to enhance the survival of a "},"document":{"title":"Embracing the Other","author":"Pearl M.
