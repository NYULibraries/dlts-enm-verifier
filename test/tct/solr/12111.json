He promised that the minister of the interior would prepare appropriate legislation to facilitate the establishment of a special council to be made up entirely of converts. This council, he intimated, would represent the interests of the converts before the authorities. Until such time as the technical and legislative details setting up this council would be completed, the converts were to be represented by a convert serving on the existing Jewish Council and heading a subcommittee to be set up for the converts. The legislation being prepared by the interior minister would even allow the converts to protest in case the Jewish Council acted against them dishonestly or took exaggerated steps against them.\nWith regard to the converts being required to wear the yellow six-pointed star, Sztojay reiterated his stand—that the emblem did not represent any religious belief.

The government was even ready to permit the employment of Christian domestics by families whose children were Christian, even if one of the parents was Jewish.\nRegarding the expropriation of property belonging to the head of a Jewish family whose children were Christian, Sztojay wrote as follows: “The Royal Hungarian Government would take care that such property would receive due consideration in accordance with the existing legislation when the time came for the future of such property to be decided.”67\nAs for the Jewish problem in general, Sztojay noted, “It is impossible to jeopardize the life and future of 13 1/2 million Hungarians for the sake of one million Jews.”68 Sztojay did not deem it necessary to explain to Seredi in detail just how the survival of Jews would jeopardize “the life and future” of the Hungarians, and how their destruction would guarantee them. It would seem that he was not worried about the possibility of Seredi asking him that question. On May 10, Seredi wrote to the prime minister once again:\nI must again repeat my demand for discrimination between converted Jews and Jews adhering to the Israelite faith. This applies especially to cases in which Christians of Jewish origin are to be housed with Israelites in the same flats, houses, ghettos, labor camps, etc….
