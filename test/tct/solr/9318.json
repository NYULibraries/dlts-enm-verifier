Should they continue drinking their coffee out of empty jam jars, or have their families send them ceramic mugs? Should one feel resentful of his wife, who sent his favorite cardigan to Egypt against the cold? Should one ask his parents to send his record collection? Should one proceed to take university courses by correspondence while it was unknown whether they would be of any use?\nThe existential point of view claims that the moral choice is to remain in one’s own reality, accept it for what it is (“create your own home playing field,” in Rami’s words), and make the best of it. This is human destiny, even in a normal life that seems to be running its natural course, without traumas or disasters. Should we spend our lives “sitting with our suitcase packed,” wasting resources, waiting for the end to come? Alternatively, we can exhibit courage and creativity and use our potential to build a life of significance.\nThe story of the ten heroes of this book teaches us that this is actually possible. While it relates the case of a concrete universe, a group of ten men sharing a single cell in jail, the narrative clearly reflects the basic dilemmas of human life with their potentials and hazards. By this book we thus convey a message of human survival and hope.\n\n"},"document":{"title":"Seasons of Captivity","author":"Amia Lieblich","publisher":"New York University Press","id":39,"isbn":"9780814750957"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_12","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch00_fm07_intro.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_12\">","css_selector":"#page_12","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_12\"]"},"next_location_id":9319,"previous_location_id":9317}]
