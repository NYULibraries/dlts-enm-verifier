This preponderant stream in the GOP appears to include both old-style “Main Street” Republicans such as Dole and Bush, and those “New Right” conservatives who emphasize economic opportunity, such as Quayle and Gingrich (the latter has an openly lesbian sister). In Gingrich’s words, “Our position should be toleration; it shouldn’t be condemnation and it shouldn’t be promotion.” Toleration as this group defines it does not include antidiscrimination laws, open LGBs in the military, or government funding for LGB artists; these are viewed as government action that “promotes” homosexuality or its acceptance.\nThe mainstream of Republican thought holds that heterosexuality is the natural and moral norm; that the causes of sexual orientation are unclear; and that society and government therefore should seek to push those who may be on the fence toward heterosexuality and “normal” marriage and family life. It also holds, however, that people who do become lesbian, gay, or bisexual should not be persecuted or cast out, rather allowed to live their lives, albeit with limitations. For example, “tolerant” social conservatives would not allow samesex marriage or domestic partnership, and would not permit open LGBs to adopt or provide foster care for children, or to conceive them through artificial insemination or surrogacy. Yet they would not take LGB parents’ own children away from them, and they appear to hold to a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy with regard to schoolteachers and others who work closely with children.\nThe Lavender Vote in ’96: Where Will It Go?\nPerhaps the most important finding of this study for the average reader is that a significant share of the LGB vote is up for grabs between the two major parties. That this was true in 1990 is clear; it was less clear in 1992. What about after 1996, when LGB rights will likely be a major issue dwarfing 1992 and with the Religious Right holding a dominant position in the Republican nominating process?\nThe Republicans can maintain their substantial foothold of LGB support only if they do not cater to the demands of the Religious Right for the public condemnation of homosexuals. Postconvention and postelection surveys indicated that the 1992 Bush-Quayle campaign was tarnished, even among middle-of-the-road heterosexuals, by the perception of intolerance and narrowmindedness as a result of the hard-right tone of that year’s Republican convention. In this context, the ability of more gay-sympathetic congressional Republicans to keep conservative and moderate LGB voters in their electoral coalitions will depend largely on two factors: the extent to which the 1996 "},"document":{"title":"The Lavender Vote","author":"Mark Hertzog","publisher":"New York University Press","id":60,"isbn":"9780814735305"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":23871,"display_name":"Bush, George -- anti-gay tone of 1992 campaign"},"id":63824,"ring_next":15765,"ring_prev":15765},{"basket":{"id":23873,"display_name":"Bush, George -- and LGB Republicans"},"id":63835,"ring_next":15765,"ring_prev":15981},{"basket":{"id":23889,"display_name":"Dole, Robert -- attitudes toward homosexuality"},"id":63868,"ring_next":16021,"ring_prev":15990},{"basket":{"id":24000,"display_name":"Quayle, Dan: attitudes of, toward LGBs"},"id":64161,"ring_next":15764,"ring_prev":15764},{"basket":{"id":23981,"display_name":"Weld, William"},"id":64267,"ring_next":15867,"ring_prev":15991}],"localid":"page_230","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chp07.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_230\">","css_selector":"#page_230","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_230\"]"},"next_location_id":15993,"previous_location_id":15991}]
