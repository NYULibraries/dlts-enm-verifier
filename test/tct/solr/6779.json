In 2006, a New York Times Magazine article suggested that the link may be one of the most important inventions of the last fifty years. For links are not only ubiquitous; they are the basic forces that relate creative works to one another for fun, fame, or fortune. Through links, individuals and organizations nominate what ideas and actors should be heard and with what priority. They also indicate to audiences which associations among topics are worthwhile and which are not. Various stakeholders in society recognize the political and economic value of these connections. Corporations, governments, nonprofits and individual media users often work to privilege certain ideas over others by creating and highlighting certain links and not others. The fact that the Federal Trade Commission's Web site, for example, highlights links to reports with certain approaches to privacy protection and not to others not only reflects the commission's political views but may also bolster those views by pointing the public toward certain ideas at the expense of others. Through these sorts of activities, linking affects the overall size and shape of the public sphere.\nAny discussion of how to promote a healthy society offline as well as online must therefore pay close attention to links. The aim should be to facilitate the widest possible sharing of varied, reliably sourced information in order to encourage specialized groups and society as a whole to confront their past and present in relation to the future. With a cornucopia of new media technologies and millions of Web sites and blogs, it would be easy to assume this goal is imminent. Yet a wide range of critics has lamented that this is not in fact the case. Some claim that both mainstream and nonestablishment sectors of the digital media target people who already agree with them, by producing content that reinforces, rather than challenges, their shared points of view. Other critics claim that media users themselves show little inclination toward diverse ideas. On the contrary, they tend to use the Web to confirm their own world-views—for example, by going to political blogs with which they sympathize politically or even by ignoring news on the Web and on TV altogether.\nHow should we understand these claims that linking is not living up to its possibilities? What evidence do we have for them? What are the political, economic, and social factors that guide linking in mainstream media firms and among individual actors such as bloggers and wikipedians? What should we expect audiences to know about links? What do they know, and what do they want? And, finally, what new research approaches\n"},"document":{"title":"The Hyperlinked Society: Questioning Connections in the Digital Age","author":"Turrow, Joseph; Tsui, Lokman","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":32,"isbn":"9780472024537"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":30,"display_name":"blogs"},"id":30482,"ring_next":6783,"ring_prev":6485},{"basket":{"id":9632,"display_name":"Federal Trade Commission"},"id":30800,"ring_next":11442,"ring_prev":11442},{"basket":{"id":9673,"display_name":"Global Positioning System (GPS)"},"id":30897,"ring_next":6845,"ring_prev":6993},{"basket":{"id":9742,"display_name":"magazines"},"id":31147,"ring_next":6785,"ring_prev":6776},{"basket":{"id":9790,"display_name":"New York"},"id":31361,"ring_next":6784,"ring_prev":7057},{"basket":{"id":2914,"display_name":"New York Times Magazine"},"id":31413,"ring_next":28079,"ring_prev":2286},{"basket":{"id":9792,"display_name":"News"},"id":31414,"ring_next":6781,"ring_prev":7059},{"basket":{"id":9847,"display_name":"Privacy"},"id":31586,"ring_next":6787,"ring_prev":6778},{"basket":{"id":2244,"display_name":"public sphere"},"id":31618,"ring_next":6791,"ring_prev":6214}],"localid":"page_4","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/intro.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_4\">","css_selector":"#page_4","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_4\"]"},"next_location_id":6780,"previous_location_id":6778}]
