Krugovaia poruka).110\nIn most of these examples responsibility is being shifted away from the individual and on to the collective—a decidedly non-masochistic move, but one in which boundaries are questioned nonetheless. In the last item the direction of the shift can be projective (“all for one”) or introjective and masochistic (“one for all”—Dmitrii Karamazov’s position precisely).\nAs for the curious expression “krugovaia poruka,” it has taken on a derogatory meaning similar to English “passing the buck.” In English, however, “the buck stops” (e.g., President Truman’s famous phrase, “The buck stops here”). In Russia the buck tends not to stop (or the attitude is that it does not stop). Rather, it goes on in endless circles (“krugovaia”), so that no one individual ever has to end up taking the blame for a morally questionable act. The collective answers for the irresponsible action of an individual.111\nThis is an exaggeration, of course, for in Russia there have been and there are individuals who take personal responsibility. Indeed, there are those Dostoevskian masochists who take more responsibility than is really their due—yet another manifestation of the fuzziness of Russian interpersonal boundaries.\nThe notoriously Russian question “Who is to blame?” (“Kto vino-vat?,” as in the title of Herzen’s novel) would not come up so often in Russia if the answer were not so elusive. But the answer would not be so elusive if the individual person were more distinctly delineated from other persons or from the collective.\nIn the second half of the twentieth century the guilty individual continues to be elusive. When the post-Soviet Russian government tried to identify a culprit for some of the atrocities perpetrated during the Soviet period, the defendant in the courtroom was not an individual, but a collective, that is, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (imagine trying the Republican Party rather than, say, Caspar Weinberger or Oliver North for the Iran-Contra affair!). When on the front page of Moskovskie novosti in late 1990 Aleksandr Kabakov described a religious gathering on the notorious Lubianka Square, he referred to the location as a “symbol of our general inescapable guilt,” and declared that spiritual cleansing entails “the soul of the people [dusha narodnaia],” "},"document":{"title":"The Slave Soul of Russia","author":"Daniel Rancour-Laferriere","publisher":"New York University Press","id":49,"isbn":"9780814774823"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1857,"display_name":"communism"},"id":51941,"ring_next":15024,"ring_prev":12455},{"basket":{"id":19200,"display_name":"Herzen, Alexander"},"id":52480,"ring_next":12484,"ring_prev":12276},{"basket":{"id":19242,"display_name":"Kabakov, Aleksandr"},"id":52688,"ring_next":12517,"ring_prev":12517},{"basket":{"id":19251,"display_name":"Karamazov, Dmitrii"},"id":52711,"ring_next":12467,"ring_prev":12464},{"basket":{"id":19435,"display_name":"North, Oliver"},"id":53248,"ring_next":17890,"ring_prev":26748},{"basket":{"id":19656,"display_name":"Truman, H."},"id":54114,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":19696,"display_name":"Weinberger, Caspar"},"id":54190,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_237","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch09.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_237\">","css_selector":"#page_237","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_237\"]"},"next_location_id":12467,"previous_location_id":12465}]
