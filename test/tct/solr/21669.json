[{"id":21669,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"80-page_xvi","content_descriptor":"page xvi","text":"the achievement of social change; and a hope that the visibility of the written word has the potential to reach people within and beyond academia in a way that appeals to more than detached intellectual interest, a way that actualizes “humanistic” study in its profoundest sense.\nAny inquiry into issues of gay or lesbian representations must be circumscribed by the recognition of real lives in peril, by the urgency of achieving social change that ensures the safety of those lives and makes them livable. Human beings are constantly subject to powerful, if constructed, categories, and those categories have concrete consequences that affect happiness, health, opportunity, safety, even life and death. In reality, most of these outcomes remain untouched by even the most dazzling of our theoretical insights. There are obvious limitations to approaching social change through academic means, undeniable drawbacks to the slow timetable and the indirect effects of scholarly pursuits. Arguably, such writing may never save an adolescent life, may never arrive in time, may never reach those whose lives we dream of changing. The specter of adolescent suicide, and of other physical and emotional violence inflicted on lesbians and gay men by themselves and others, is a constant reminder of how many lives have been and remain beyond our reach.\nYet there are also possibilities here, opportunities for reaching out in the hope that our work will mean something to someone, with the belief that it can make a difference. Scholarship of this sort, like the inauguration of a lecture series, is not simply a memorial to what has been, not only a means of recognizing what is past. It is also a statement of hope, a belief that despite the tragedies we have not been able to prevent, there are some that perhaps we can. It is, above all, a commitment to creating another kind of future. In a sense, this may be what all of us—as scholars, writers, and simply human beings—in our highest aspirations seek to achieve.\n\n\n"},"document":{"title":"Freedom to Differ","author":"Diane Helene Miller","publisher":"New York University Press","id":80,"isbn":"9780814755969"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":32920,"display_name":"Lesbians and gay men -- representations of"},"id":83180,"ring_next":21677,"ring_prev":21827}],"localid":"page_xvi","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/preface.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_xvi\">","css_selector":"#page_xvi","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_xvi\"]"},"next_location_id":21670,"previous_location_id":21668}]
