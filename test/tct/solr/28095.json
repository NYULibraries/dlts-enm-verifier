Amazingly, Krauthammer does not mention the fact that the Croatian recapturing of the Krajina region was motivated by (1) the inability of Croats to make any progress after negotiating for three years for the return of their sovereign territory; (2) the Croatian efforts to guarantee Serbian autonomy in a Croatian state; and (3) the desire to stop further killing of Muslims and Croats in UN declared safe areas. Nor is mention made of the fact that while the West stood by, the Croat assistance of the Bosnians saved lives. Such historical context is rarely provided in such articles and, in this case, the standard line of “the Serbs were justified in invading and ethnically cleansing Croatia because of the Sahovnica and the kuna” takes precedence. Krauthammer is apparently unaware that his logic is exactly the same as that of indicted war criminals Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladic. A more in-depth study of this kind of relativism in major media is called for.\n42. Many groups have also taken a moral stand on the slaughter in Bosnia, including the American Committee to Save Bosnia. Consider also advertisements such as the following: “In Memoriam: Our Commitments, Principles, and Moral Values. Died: Bosnia 1994. On the occasion of the 1000th day of the siege of Sarajevo.” It was published in the New York Times, December 29, 1994, A6, and signed by Daniel Bell, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Hodding Carter, Leslie Gelb, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, Bianca Jagger, Carl Sagan, Susan Sontag, and Simon Wiesenthal.\n43. Warren Zimmermann, “The Last Ambassador: A Memoir of the Collapse of Yugoslavia,” Foreign Affairs, March-April, 1995, 3–20. Zimmermann adds that “The Slovenes bear considerable responsibility for the bloodbath that followed their secession. . . . Tudjman [is] an implacable nationalist. . . . Unlike Milošević, who is driven by power, Tudjman is obsessed by nationalism. . . . It was the Slovenes who started the war.” Slaven Letica provides a response to Zimmermann’s article in this volume.\n44. See, for instance, Thomas Masaryk, “Nationality and Internationalism” and “The Meaning of Our National Revival,” in Constructive Sociological Theory, ed. Alan Woolfolk and Jonathan B. Imber (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction, 1994), 259–66 and 279–88. Indeed, Masaryk saw constructive nationalism as an antidote to the threat of communism. It is rare for Western intellectuals to see any constructive dimensions of ethnic nationalism.\n45.
