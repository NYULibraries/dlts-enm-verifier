The full equality of all members of the human species and their close relationship to one another mandates that Bahá’ís regard people from all racial, religious, ethnic, class, and national backgrounds as members of one global human family. Rather than offering mere “symbols of internationalism” in the hope that these might, as Allport (1954) suggested, “provide mental anchorage points around which the idea of world-loyalty may develop” (44), the Bahá’í religion begins with the underlying principle of world loyalty and human unity, which is itself the anchorage point, “the pivot,” according to Shoghi Effendi (1955), “round which all the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh revolve” (42). The extension of the individual’s personal commitments and relationships to include the diverse groups that compose humanity is repeatedly urged in Bahá’í texts in the strongest terms possible—that is, as no less than a divine commandment:\nIn every dispensation, there hath been the commandment of fellowship and love, but it was a commandment limited to the community of those in mutual agreement, not to the dissident foe. In this wondrous age, however, praised be God, the commandments of God are not delimited, not restricted to any one group of people, rather have all the friends been commanded to show forth fellowship and love, consideration and generosity and loving-kindness to every community on earth. (’Abdu’l-Bahá 1978, 20–21)\nFar from being an abstract principle removed from real social conditions, the unity of humankind must be lived in practice, as ‘Abdu’1-Bahá (1969) told a gathering in Europe in 1912:\nDo not be content with showing friendship in words alone. … When you meet a [stranger], speak to him as to a friend; if he seems to be lonely try to help him, give him of your willing service; if he be sad console him, if poor succour him, if oppressed rescue him. …\nWhat profit is there in agreeing that universal friendship is good, and "},"document":{"title":"Embracing the Other","author":"Pearl M.
