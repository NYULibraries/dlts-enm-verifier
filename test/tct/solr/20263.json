They use it in a special sense to designate all their political organs. We all recall the various peoples fronts organized to promote the Communist cause throughout the world. More specifically the Chinese Communist army was referred to in Communist parlance as the people’s army.103\n“People” is one of the most generic and colorless terms available to denote an aggregate of human beings. McCarthy recognizes this when he contrasts the communist “special meaning” with “our sense,” innocent and inclusive. The communist “people,” according to McCarthy, who freights the usage in this context with sinister implications, is only a ruse, an attempt to pass beneath the threshold of signification. The achievement of discerning a particular significance is secondary to the achievement of recognizing that there is a significance to be discerned.\nMcCarthy’s struggle to separate the significant from the insignificant is unremitting. Figure-ground discriminations are not clear in the dark world of the fantastic: “Note those words, Mr. President.” “Mr. President, listen to this.” “I call the Senate’s attention to this statement.” “Listen to this if you will.”104 In a complex, relativistic world, all events require interpretation; nothing is unworthy of our attention.\nI have concentrated on how McCarthy used his evidence to create tensions between belief and doubt in his audiences, but none of McCarthy’s evidence would ever have been given a forum had it not been for the power of his office. There is no doubting that much of the credence given McCarthy’s claims resulted from his status as a U.S. senator. As David Oshinsky has phrased the question that had to be raised by McCarthy’s charges, “Would a United States senator go this far out on a limb without hard evidence?”105 Millard Tydings knew very well that as a senator, McCarthy was more likely to be believed than someone standing “on the corner of 9th and G’streets who is carrying on a casual conversation,”106 and Walter Lippman recognized the power of the office when he argued that McCarthy’s charges, because he was a senator, were news and had to be treated as such, however reluctantly; McCarthy could not be suppressed by the media.107\nThough the institutions of the media could not, without the benison of the Senate, themselves author McCarthy’s undoing, the representational power of the media, especially television, did serve a critical enabling function when the Senate finally decided that McCarthy had overstepped the bounds of allowable conduct. And it is consistent with the thesis argued here that, in the instances where the media authored its own scripts, some "},"document":{"title":"The Prophetic Tradition and Radical Rhetoric in America","author":"James Darsey","publisher":"New York University Press","id":75,"isbn":"9780814718766"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":30515,"display_name":"ethos -- McCarthy's"},"id":77234,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30736,"display_name":"Lippman, Walter, on McCarthy's power"},"id":77613,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30780,"display_name":"McCarthy, Joseph -- and the ethos of the Senate"},"id":77686,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30781,"display_name":"McCarthy, Joseph -- and the media"},"id":77687,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30839,"display_name":"Oshinsky, David, on McCarthy"},"id":77783,"ring_next":20265,"ring_prev":20265},{"basket":{"id":31081,"display_name":"Tydings, Millard"},"id":78179,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_145","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch07.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_145\">","css_selector":"#page_145","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_145\"]"},"next_location_id":20264,"previous_location_id":20262}]
