At the time, they judge online editions not yet viable in light of weak and primitive infrastructure, uneven distribution, and excessive cost to consumers in conjunction with political and social constraints; and attribute the content homogeneity of print and online editions to similar factors. The study sets a good example in its endeavor to integrate technology into a larger picture, even if the pace of Internet development in China has superseded the findings.\nXin’s (2010) study of interactions between conventional news media and “citizen journalism” from blogs and other informal channels yields fairly predictable findings—that netizen accounts are an increasingly important news source for mainstream outlets in China as well as constituting an alternative conduit for information, while party controls still shape public use of the Web. More noteworthy is attention to the element of interactivity, which is certainly vital to understanding how technology alters the interactions of audiences and producers in the new media environment, and thus germane to studying restructuring of the field of news production.\nAn additional caveat against ascribing too much potency to grassroots media activity comes from Pugsley (2010), whose study of Chinese coverage of major domestic news events during 2008 suggests the state maintains overall hegemony over media culture even as global influences erode aspects of state control. In this context, he cautions that the role of citizen journalists should not be over-estimated given their limited “ability to create ongoing networks of dependable news-gathering.”\nExamining joint ventures in China’s Internet industry, Weber and Jia (2007) do not address news media per se, but their findings nevertheless are suggestive for understanding changes in fields of media production, especially the element of self-restraint. Their focus is the fast-growing online entertainment sector, in the service of which state media employ what they call “strategic commercialization,” an approach intended to elicit maximum returns through appeals to consumer audiences. The strategy includes co-production arrangements and importation of cultural content, encouraging domestic Internet portals to make cooperative deals with global media firms for developing online services and products. Case studies of several such joint ventures suggest that the most successful hinge on “targeted” entertainment provision, with technology coordinated with content needs.\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2146,"display_name":"Case study"},"id":6509,"ring_next":2136,"ring_prev":2121},{"basket":{"id":2150,"display_name":"China -- China's media"},"id":6569,"ring_next":2132,"ring_prev":2122},{"basket":{"id":2248,"display_name":"hegemony"},"id":7148,"ring_next":2152,"ring_prev":2119},{"basket":{"id":250,"display_name":"internet"},"id":7360,"ring_next":2154,"ring_prev":2122},{"basket":{"id":295,"display_name":"journalism"},"id":7417,"ring_next":2152,"ring_prev":2120},{"basket":{"id":2320,"display_name":"Media production"},"id":7609,"ring_next":2125,"ring_prev":2122},{"basket":{"id":2340,"display_name":"Networking"},"id":7789,"ring_next":2146,"ring_prev":2032},{"basket":{"id":2346,"display_name":"\"new media\""},"id":7827,"ring_next":2157,"ring_prev":2078}],"localid":"page_236","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter11.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_236\">","css_selector":"#page_236","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_236\"]"},"next_location_id":2124,"previous_location_id":2122}]
