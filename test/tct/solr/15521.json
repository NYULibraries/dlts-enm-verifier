The poem “Emilia Plater” was especially propagated in the school curriculum during the Communist period despite the anti-Russian content. Since the collapse of communism and the onset of the family-oriented Catholic nationalist campaign, its imagery is largely absent from public discourse, which has been taken over by the Polish Mother ethos.\nBozena Choluj,30 who significantly ignores the existence of the other myth of a cross-dressing woman-hero (as it is absent from the post-Communist nationalist discourse), explains instead that, in today’s Poland the equation of Heavenly and Polish Mother continues as a model of double service for women to follow.
