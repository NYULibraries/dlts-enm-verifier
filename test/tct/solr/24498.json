For some scholars, criticism is a matter of perspective—detached, analytical, and dispassionate.

And if freedom is the very soul of inquiry, then objectivity is the flesh and bones. I have often wondered, not so much at the putative power of the intellect over the sensate, but that the two means of knowing are often presented as an either-or proposition, while the spiritual has been removed from the formula entirely. Academic perspective is either internal or external; it is never both simultaneously; it rarely reflects the motion of life.

Jim Crow had something to do with it in the South, but in the premier Northern bastions of critical inquiry and knowledge production, the shunning of the Negro scholar was explained as a matter of “perspective.” How could “they” ever be sufficiently objective to critically examine and interpret the black experience? Predominantly white universities were closed to them from the time that Alain Locke and W. E. B. Du Bois, Charles S.
