They are often quite offended when someone changes something they have written in an entry, and are even more unhappy if one of the Wikipedia editing bots deletes something they have written for being insufficiently notable. Others are thrilled when “their” entry catches the attention of other readers, and people out there in the wilds of the Internet begin to change and improve what they have written. For example, in February 2007, one of my students wrote an entry on David and Catherine Birnie of Australia, the only known husband and wife serial killers.45 I did not really want to know why she was interested in the Birnies, but it was something she wanted to write about, and she did well. By the end of the semester, her entry had been edited many times by others, and she was quite proud of the form it had taken by May of that year. That particular student has gone on to become an active Wikipedia editor, and continues to work on various entries that she has an interest in or commitment to. Her experiences demonstrate the value of giving students assignments that require them to take active roles in the making of history online.\nThis final example speaks to a theme woven throughout this book—the need to engage students where they live—namely, in the digital space where they are creating content for others to see, use, and remix. The malleability of information is a notion that students are often much more comfortable with than we generally are. Our teaching strategies need to change to help them explore new ways to combine what they do daily—create online content—with what we do. By showing them how the practices of the professional historian can be adapted to the digital realm, we help them see the process of online content creation as something more than just fun or “what they do.” Instead, it becomes a way to be historians in the digital space, to analyze historical information, and then present it in ways that are useful to others, that have staying power well beyond the end of the semester and the awarding of a grade, and that have relevance to the lives they are living now and plan to live after graduation.\n\n\n\n"},"document":{"title":"Teaching History in the Digital Age","author":"Kelly, T.
