Markus Prior has argued convincingly that changes in the structure of television have enabled differential patterns of news viewing, which effectively polarize the public into those with and those without political knowledge.50 While a case can be made that people who avoid hard news are “rationally ignorant,”51 I find Prior's results a troubling prospect for democracy. What is less clear, though, is the extent to which consumers of news and information limit their diets largely to one ideological point of view. Iyengar and Morin's study of online news readership52 and Adamic and Glance's analysis of the linking structures among political blogs53 suggest systematic “blue/red” biases in people's patterns of consumption across time. Conversely, Hargittai, Gallo and Kane's study of political blogs54 and a Pew study of Internet use55 emphasize the tendencies of people to reference and/or know opposing points of view. Prior himself has noted that viewers of the Fox News Channel see other sources of TV news, which suggests a vertical diversity of exposure consistent with broader findings on TV viewing.56\nQuestions about the Marketplace\nThe shape of public attention is important because it suggests how the marketplace of ideas will operate in an age of on-demand digital media. Two questions are, to me, particularly salient. The first is whether our society's cultural center will hold in the wake of all these changes. This is and should be subject to ongoing empirical investigation. The second normative question addresses the wisdom of the data-aggregating systems that increasingly define the character of the nonlinear media environment.\nWill the Center Hold? In his zeal for the long tail, Anderson has asserted that “infinite choice equals ultimate fragmentation.”57 It's hard to imagine a common culture—let alone a vibrant democracy—whose patterns of attention are evenly spread across an infinite number of choices. Nor do I think that's likely to happen. I suspect the forces that concentrate attention, as already outlined, will save us from flying off in every conceivable direction. That said, it's clear that many more things are competing for our attention. These inevitably come at the expense of the older forms of media that once commanded center stage. They were sometimes derided as offering only the lowest common denominator, but\n"},"document":{"title":"The Hyperlinked Society: Questioning Connections in the Digital Age","author":"Turrow, Joseph; Tsui, Lokman","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":32,"isbn":"9780472024537"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":9496,"display_name":"Adamic, Lada A."},"id":30274,"ring_next":6851,"ring_prev":6790},{"basket":{"id":9509,"display_name":"Anderson, C."},"id":30364,"ring_next":6810,"ring_prev":6805},{"basket":{"id":9537,"display_name":"Blogger"},"id":30430,"ring_next":6809,"ring_prev":6791},{"basket":{"id":9541,"display_name":"Blogroll"},"id":30477,"ring_next":6816,"ring_prev":7018},{"basket":{"id":30,"display_name":"blogs"},"id":30503,"ring_next":6809,"ring_prev":6806},{"basket":{"id":9553,"display_name":"Buchwald, A."},"id":30552,"ring_next":6907,"ring_prev":6907},{"basket":{"id":9641,"display_name":"FOX"},"id":30816,"ring_next":6831,"ring_prev":7083},{"basket":{"id":9642,"display_name":"Fox News Channel"},"id":30828,"ring_next":6829,"ring_prev":7083},{"basket":{"id":9643,"display_name":"Fragmentation"},"id":30837,"ring_next":6809,"ring_prev":6806},{"basket":{"id":9650,"display_name":"Gallo, Jason"},"id":30853,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":9663,"display_name":"Glance, N."},"id":30882,"ring_next":6851,"ring_prev":6790},{"basket":{"id":9681,"display_name":"Hargittai, E."},"id":30986,"ring_next":6860,"ring_prev":6797},{"basket":{"id":9714,"display_name":"Iyengar, S."},"id":31077,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":9720,"display_name":"Kane, M."},"id":31103,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":9737,"display_name":"Long tail"},"id":31127,"ring_next":6839,"ring_prev":6804},{"basket":{"id":9771,"display_name":"Morin, R."},"id":31255,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":9792,"display_name":"News"},"id":31444,"ring_next":6810,"ring_prev":6806},{"basket":{"id":9808,"display_name":"O'Reilly, T."},"id":31490,"ring_next":6904,"ring_prev":6907},{"basket":{"id":9846,"display_name":"Prior, M."},"id":31583,"ring_next":6955,"ring_prev":6791},{"basket":{"id":9882,"display_name":"Salon.com"},"id":31701,"ring_next":7007,"ring_prev":7037},{"basket":{"id":347,"display_name":"television."},"id":31885,"ring_next":6809,"ring_prev":6805},{"basket":{"id":7403,"display_name":"videos"},"id":31970,"ring_next":6816,"ring_prev":6799},{"basket":{"id":6341,"display_name":"Web 2.0"},"id":32013,"ring_next":6904,"ring_prev":6715}],"localid":"page_33","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap01.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_33\">","css_selector":"#page_33","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_33\"]"},"next_location_id":6809,"previous_location_id":6807}]
