No one can say … why the child often reverts in certain characteristics to its grandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor.”2\nIn the latter part of the nineteenth century, controlled experiments in botany confirmed Darwin’s idea that mutations leading to fitness enhanced survival. Finally, in 1900, unknown to each other and unaware of Mendel, three botanists rediscovered Mendel’s laws. Each of the three—Karl Correns of Germany, Erich von Tschermak of Austria, and Hugo de Vries of Holland—searched the literature, found Mendel’s paper, and credited him for the discovery. Thus we speak today of Mendel’s laws and Mendelian inheritance rather than Correns’s laws or de Vries’s inheritance.\nNot every scientist has been as gracious as Correns, von Tschermak, and de Vries, but their reference to Mendel does illustrate the fundamental role priority plays in the value system of science. It’s coming in first that counts—not how well-written your paper is or even how clever you may be. An independent rediscovery might take as much sheer brilliance as the original discovery, but it does not generate equal fame. Indeed, even if the trio of researchers in 1900 had not cited Mendel, we still might invoke the monk’s name if later research had uncovered his work. By rewarding priority science puts progress first. A researcher seeking recognition within the scientific establishment is on notice that repeating old work will not lead to the greatest rewards. Finally, the emphasis on priority supports the cumulative nature of science. One reads earlier work to avoid repetition, and one is then in a position to build on that work.\nThe contrast with law is striking. Consider the development of the idea of privacy, a concept that, as we will see, has important implications for individuals’ control over information about their genetic makeup. Most lawyers and legal scholars associate the early development of modern privacy law with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis. It was, after all, Brandeis who wrote the famous dissent in the 1928 Olmstead case in which he called for extending the constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures to wiretapping,3 a position the Supreme Court ultimately adopted in 1967.4 In the most famous passage in Olmstead, Brandeis said that the makers of our Constitution “conferred, as against the Government, the right to be let alone—the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued "},"document":{"title":"Culture Clash","author":"Steven Goldberg","publisher":"New York University Press","id":97,"isbn":"9780814730911"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":23335,"display_name":"Brandeis, Justice Louis D."},"id":99965,"ring_next":15056,"ring_prev":26213},{"basket":{"id":40845,"display_name":"Katz v.
