It was Mrs. Clinton who championed the large, complex health care proposal that went down to defeat. Evidence from senior advisers who spoke to Drew (1994) suggests that Mrs. Clinton has a very robust view of what the Clintons came to Washington to accomplish. If anything, the evidence suggests that Hillary Clinton reinforces her husband’s activist tendencies rather than inhibits them.\nThe Question of Focus in Relation to Judgment\nThe matter of whether Hillary Clinton reinforces or inhibits President Clinton’s activist tendencies is important in a very basic and direct way in relation to the quality of judgments in the Clinton presidency. Good policy and political judgment requires time, as well as information and perspective. Generally, the more initiatives that a president undertakes, the less time there is to focus on any one of them.\nThe lack of presidential focus has emerged as a major drawback in President Clinton’s decision-making style. Many of the problems in the Clinton White House documented by Drew (1994) and Woodward (1994) grew out of Clinton’s and his advisers’ attempts to take on too many things. Bruce Lindsey, a senior presidential aide, told Elizabeth Drew that\nthere are only twenty-four hours in the day, and you should sleep a few of them. You can’t be meeting with Boris Yeltsin, reforming health care, and working on campaign reform, lobbying restrictions, education reform, and welfare reform. If you try that you can’t be effective on anything. What he’s [Clinton] starting to do is to figure out the best use of his time. He would say [the problem] is the way he’s been scheduled, because he never thinks he has taken on too much. (Quoted in Drew 1994, 134—35; emphasis mine)\nThe inability to recognize and accept limits that is central to President Clinton’s psychology is also central to his presidency. President Clinton is a man of large appetites, which is another way of saying that he dislikes and is uncomfortable with limits. In clinical terms, the idea that one need not take account of or be bound by limits is a reflection of grandiosity.\nThis characteristic can sometimes be useful in allowing individuals to go beyond what is considered possible, sometimes to very good effect. However, it can also prove very damaging, when it keeps individuals intent on accomplishing all from accomplishing much. It must also be noted here that psychological characteristics like grandiosity must be seriously considered in the context of the setting in which they operate.\n"},"document":{"title":"The Psychological Assessment of Presidential Candidates","author":"Stanley A.
