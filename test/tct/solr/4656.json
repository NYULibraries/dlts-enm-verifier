Wastes, too, are a critical part of this natural history: they are not excrescences to be weeded out at some future date. If waste, as Hawkins suggests, is “inevitable,”9 this is not because of some tacit agreement with rampant forces of production and consumption but because no society can entirely rid itself of waste. By acknowledging the inevitability of waste, it is possible to think of it not exclusively as a menace to be eradicated but as a formative part of our material lives.\nVisions of a waste-free future potentially obscure the very conditions through which waste emerges. Once waste is understood as an integral aspect of processes of materialization, it is no longer possible to imagine its complete elimination or to position it simply as raw material to be fed into friction-free futures. Instead, the persistence of waste occurs in part through the unavoidable remainders that do not easily recycle into new systems of production or that are left behind as the pollution and residue from previous activities. Waste does not consist just of the fossils from past cycles of production and consumption; it is also the remainders generated from continually unanticipated futures. When proposals are made for a “solution” to the waste “problem,” waste is often displaced back into the same productive mechanism that produced waste in the first place.10 But as discussed in chapter 5, such a “discount on the future,” as Van Loon and Sabelis characterize it,11 does not account for the “costs of irreversibility,”12 which will contribute to future complexities beyond our present methods of accounting. By appending “zero” to waste, we obstruct the possibility of considering how irreversibility and remainder emerge as integral aspects of waste.13\nAs long as our basic approach to waste depends on its eventual and continual eradication, it will be difficult to grasp the ways in which waste emerges and operates—as generative and dynamic and, as Hawkins suggests, as the “terrain of ethics.”14 Arguably, the development of apparent waste-eliminating strategies such as recycling not only obscures the inevitability of waste15 but also defers the ethical aspects of how we attend to waste—whether we bury it, ship it to developing countries, or leave it to future generations to trawl through. It may be possible to move beyond a “dos and don'ts” approach to waste, as Van Loon and Sabelis write, and instead “to generate a radical reconceptualization of waste itself.”16 Rather than consider recycling as the instant reintegration of waste into the market, it may be possible to attend to the ways in which waste—as a mutable and relational object—offers “possibilities for the unexpected, "},"document":{"title":"Digital Rubbish: A Natural History of Electronics","author":"Gabrys, Jennifer","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":22,"isbn":"9780472029402"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":6187,"display_name":"Hawkins, Gay"},"id":19015,"ring_next":4728,"ring_prev":4588},{"basket":{"id":6213,"display_name":"Loon, Joost Van, and Ida Sabelis"},"id":19135,"ring_next":4679,"ring_prev":4644},{"basket":{"id":6221,"display_name":"materiality"},"id":19190,"ring_next":4657,"ring_prev":4645},{"basket":{"id":1668,"display_name":"nature"},"id":19334,"ring_next":4661,"ring_prev":4655},{"basket":{"id":6270,"display_name":"recycling"},"id":19505,"ring_next":4675,"ring_prev":4638}],"localid":"page_150","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/conclusion.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_150\">","css_selector":"#page_150","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_150\"]"},"next_location_id":4657,"previous_location_id":4655}]
