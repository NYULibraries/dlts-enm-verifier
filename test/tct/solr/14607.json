Zuzanna Smolenska\nAs the title suggests, the chapters in this section concern the growth of altruism over the life span and the internal and external factors that mediate altruistic behavior. In chapter 6, Krebs and Van Hesteren advance a “developmental-interactional” approach to altruistic personality that, they claim, counteracts the problems of past approaches. Krebs and Van Hesteren maintain that the patterns of altruistic behavior people display stem from and are shaped by the stages of development they have achieved, and that the forms of prosocial behavior that stem from higher stage structures are more altruistic than the forms that stem from lower stage structures. They suggest that the stages of development described by theorists such as Maslow, Piaget, Loevinger, Kegan, Selman, Hoffman, Haan, Kohlberg, Gilligan, and Eisenberg correspond to one another along basic structural dimensions, and that each set of corresponding stage structures exerts a press toward a different type of altruism. The writers outline eight ideal types of altruism derived from the defining characteristics of corresponding stages of development, which they call undifferentiated responsiveness (Stage 0), egocentric accommodation (Stage 1), instrumental cooperation (Stage 2), mutual (Stage 3), conscientious (Stage 4), autonomous (Stage 5), integrated (Stage 6), and universal love (“stage 7”).\nThe developmental-interactional approach to altruism advanced by Krebs and Van Hesteren raises several challenging questions. First, how do different cognitively based stage structures give rise to different types of altruistic behavior; what internal processes mediate the link between thought and action? Second, in what sense—on what basis—can the forms of prosocial behavior "},"document":{"title":"Embracing the Other","author":"Pearl M.
