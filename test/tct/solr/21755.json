The events of 1993 followed on the heels of a year that was characterized by a “dramatic shift in visibility and credibility” of the gay and lesbian movement (Vaid 1995, 151). The events surrounding both Cammermeyer and Achtenberg were precipitated, although in different ways and with differing results, by the nomination and election of the first Democratic president who made lesbian and gay rights a plank in his official campaign platform. Bill Clinton’s presidency, with its promise of broader opportunities and acceptance for gays and lesbians, both reflected and reinforced the heightened visibility and newly amplified political voice belonging to gays and lesbians.\nCandidate Clinton drew strong support from gay and lesbian communities, both in the form of political endorsements—Achtenberg, for example, was the first elected official in California to endorse him—and through generous campaign contributions from lesbians and gay men. In return, Clinton vowed not to forget his gay and lesbian constituents if he won the election. More specifically, Clinton promised gays and lesbians greater recognition and increased political access. He pledged to appoint gays and lesbians to important posts in his administration, and he promised, in what seemed no uncertain terms, to lift the ban on gays and lesbians in the military. When Clinton was elected and announced his intention to fulfill these commitments, in particular the lifting of the ban, the intense debate that ensued with Congress gave rise to equally intensive media coverage, sparking the interest of national constituencies on both sides of the military issue. It was in this context that both Achtenberg and Cammermeyer rose to the status of national figures, as the attainment of their personal goals became linked to the raging national debate over lesbian and gay rights, whose flames were fed by Clinton’s bold promise.\nWhereas Achtenberg was an active player in the political game and a longtime lesbian activist who chose to stake her fortunes on Bill Clinton’s political acumen, Cammermeyer’s role was much less deliberate. She was pulled almost unknowingly, at least initially, into the political fray. A nurse by training and profession, a soldier by lifelong commitment, Cammermeyer had dedicated much of her life to serving her country and caring for its ailing soldiers, both on the battlefield and in the VA hospitals where she later worked. Like many other gay and lesbian service personnel, Cammermeyer had no intention of committing a rebellious act or of taking a political stand when she stated that she was a lesbian. She simply responded with the honesty she believed the situation, and the army, demanded. Her case illustrates former New Republic editor Andrew Sullivan’s claim that the military debate"},"document":{"title":"Freedom to Differ","author":"Diane Helene Miller","publisher":"New York University Press","id":80,"isbn":"9780814755969"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":32615,"display_name":"Achtenberg, Roberta"},"id":81804,"ring_next":21808,"ring_prev":21754},{"basket":{"id":32619,"display_name":"Achtenberg, Roberta -- as Clinton supporter"},"id":81824,"ring_next":21744,"ring_prev":21744},{"basket":{"id":30375,"display_name":"Clinton, Bill -- lesbian and gay support for"},"id":82129,"ring_next":15774,"ring_prev":21744},{"basket":{"id":23884,"display_name":"Clinton, Bill -- pledge to lift military ban"},"id":82132,"ring_next":21764,"ring_prev":21744},{"basket":{"id":32874,"display_name":"Lesbian and gay rights movement -- Clinton's support for"},"id":82659,"ring_next":21744,"ring_prev":21744},{"basket":{"id":32743,"display_name":"Military ban"},"id":82959,"ring_next":21757,"ring_prev":21744}],"localid":"page_86","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch3.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_86\">","css_selector":"#page_86","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_86\"]"},"next_location_id":21756,"previous_location_id":21754}]
