The informal online community of Nerdfighters consists of mostly young people, who can be primarily characterized as fans of vloggers John and Hank Green. The VlogBrothers’ YouTube channel is the centerpiece of the Nerdfighter community’s shared universe. This is exemplified in the shared ritual for novice Nerdfighters—watching all the vlogs dating from 2007, comprising over 72 hours of video. As Nerdfighter Adrian explained:\nIn order to be a really serious Nerdfighter, what do you do? You watch every single video in a chronological order. At this point, it’s been so long that I think it’s basically impossible.\nYet while the vlogs are the centerpiece, there is a much wider universe of content that Nerdfighters share, extending far beyond the Green brothers. Nerdfighters see themselves as having “shared interests,” liking the same content, and being “nerds.” In Nerdfighter Julie’s words,\nThat’s the reason why we’re there. We’re all Nerdfighters who have some shared interests, with Doctor Who and Harry Potter, Star Wars and whatever other things. But also like we’re all nerds, we’ve always been nerds who just like to think a lot. I mean, I don’t know, it’s like you can have honestly intellectual conversations.\nNerdfighters generally say that they share an interest in “everything nerdy”—a term that is very broadly defined. Nerdfighters referenced a range of examples of “nerdy stuff,” including YouTube celebrities, the musical Cats, stop motion Lego animation, and the American Museum of Natural History. This may allow for more inclusivity than the example of the HPA, which generally attracts fans of a particular franchise. Moreover, beyond their identification around “nerdy” content, Nerdfighters also self-identify as a community of DIY media producers, specifically part of the YouTube community of video producers (or “YouTubers”; see Lange 2009). As Nerdfighter Theo claimed, “these communities are really based on creating content.”\nIn terms of their participatory politics, Nerdfighters are united by a common—though amorphic—goal: “decreasing world suck.” As mentioned before, this broadly defined agenda inspires acts ranging from "},"document":{"title":"By Any Media Necessary","author":"Henry Jenkins et al","publisher":"New York University Press","id":33,"isbn":"9781479899982"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":10021,"display_name":"American Museum of Natural History"},"id":32165,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":10085,"display_name":"Cats"},"id":32309,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":10275,"display_name":"Green, John and Hank"},"id":32781,"ring_next":7247,"ring_prev":7210},{"basket":{"id":10279,"display_name":"Green, John and Hank -- as VlogBrothers"},"id":32788,"ring_next":7246,"ring_prev":7210},{"basket":{"id":10298,"display_name":"Harry Potter franchise"},"id":32850,"ring_next":7410,"ring_prev":7240},{"basket":{"id":10420,"display_name":"Lego"},"id":33145,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":10554,"display_name":"Participatory politics"},"id":33457,"ring_next":7248,"ring_prev":7220},{"basket":{"id":9488,"display_name":"YouTube.com"},"id":33966,"ring_next":7246,"ring_prev":7231}],"localid":"page_138","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chapter3.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pg_138\" title=\"138\">","css_selector":"#pg_138","xpath":"span[@id=\"pg_138\"]"},"next_location_id":7244,"previous_location_id":7242}]
