This is a concern that has dogged public scholarly work for eons, from those scholars who have written crossover books, to those who have written editorials for major publications, to those who have developed blogs and other online presences. Yes, Twitter is the most elliptical of these, but it's a key form of outreach not just to our colleagues but to the broader intellectual public, and to those whom we need to support higher education. All of these public forms of writing have the potential to demonstrate what it is that we as scholars do, and why the broader culture should care about it—and until we get over our fears of talking with the broader culture, in the forms that we share with them, we'll never manage to convince them that what we do is important.\n—KATHLEEN FITZPATRICK\nTwitter is one way to explain to graduate students what you do at big conferences. In addition to the actual intellectual conversation, the critical mass of faculty on Twitter means that you can see what faculty do: how often people go to panels, when they visit the book exhibit, when they need downtime, whether they're still working on papers, and more. There's a comfort in seeing the different ways in which faculty and graduate students inhabit the conference: There's not just one way of participating in a conference, and so you should feel empowered to make the event\n"},"document":{"title":"Hacking the Academy: New Approaches to Scholarship and Teaching from Digital Humanities","author":"Cohen, Daniel J.; Scheinfeldt, Tom","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":24,"isbn":"9780472029471"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_138","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter27.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_138\">","css_selector":"#page_138","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_138\"]"},"next_location_id":5060,"previous_location_id":5058}]
