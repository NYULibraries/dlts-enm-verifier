Smack dab in Auden’s Age of Anxiety, in an era fitfully dismantling the last stones of the New Critical fortress, Wright, a poet not preternaturally given to abundance of happiness, labors on.\nOn October 5, 1962, just seven months after the joyful flight of “Arriving in the Country Again,” Wright takes off for another “country.” This time he travels by skiff not by horse. This time the bird is night, and it possesses only “one wing.” This time he does not look away from the sun but has closed his eyes to it. Here’s Wright’s unpublished, handwritten draft of “Facing the Sun through Closed Eyelids,” a breathtakingly moving poem that, until now, no one but Wright has seen:\n \nLong ago I let the oars fall\n And float off among the ripples.\n They beached us here blind.\n Then the night raised up\n One wing, for a moment.\n We can see, for a moment.\nWhere’ve you gone?\nWhose country is this?I don’t hear any trees.\nPebbles scrape at the hull,\nCold fingers\nTap at the prow.\nAll that time I lay dying,\nI did not care, and now I am afraid\nTo lose you again.\nI think I would just as soon\nRide the black skiff once more,\nAnd get this thing over with, I think\nI would just as soon.27\nWhether in death or in the throes of despondent death-in-life, the speaker finds himself interred by the darkness of his own eyelids. What “we”—the speaker’s body and spirit—see in blindness is the strange “country” of his own inner nothingness. Its shadows are not the redemptive kind that feed ecstatic life, that elsewhere animate even a horse to embody mystical union. Instead, these shadows populate the bailiwick of the dead. “Where’ve "},"document":{"title":"Poetry's Afterlife: Verse in the Digital Age","author":"Stein, Kevin","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":14,"isbn":"9780472026708"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":4412,"display_name":"Auden, W.
