Evergreen remains faithful to its literary origins in narrating in relatively straightforward terms the lives of its two educated protagonists, Ch’ae Yŏng-sin and Pak Tong-hyŏk, and their work to enlighten and empower the rural poor.6 After meeting at a Christian youth rally in Seoul, where Pak demonstrates his fervid commitment to lifting the minjung out of poverty and Ch’ae her moxy in defending women’s equality, the two resolve to escape the stagnant and hypocritical world of Seoul intellectuals (embodied in the polite YWCA dinner where the merits of enlightenment are debated) and go directly to the people in country villages. Pak returns to his own hometown to get his hands dirty in leading communal agriculture projects while Ch’ae finds her way to Ch’ŏngsŏkgol, a poor farming village where she sets up a variety of literacy classes for children and adults. The film’s emotional core is of course its love plot, which grows as the two take turns visiting the other’s villages and as they witness the depth of the other’s political dedication, but which ultimately remains platonic. However, the dramatic energy of Evergreen lies in the gradual, sometimes troubled, but ultimately rewarding progress Ch’ae makes in her efforts to attract Ch’ŏngsŏkgol’s villagers to her classes and to build a school to accommodate them, variously enchanting the children with accordion music or earning the respect of the women by gamely helping out in the fields. Despite the interference of a local dandy just returned from his studies in Tokyo, Ch’ae manages to pool the village’s resources to build the humble but sturdy one-room school, but the strain of her cause takes its toll and she falls irreversibly ill. Meanwhile, Pak himself struggles to combat the meddling of the local landowner in his projects, and through a series of unfortunate events he is wrongly accused of arson and arrested. Upon his release from prison, he rushes to Ch’ŏngsŏkgol to be with Ch’ae, only to find that he is too late and that she has already succumbed to her disease. Emotionally shattered, he rises the next day and stoically rings the school’s piercing bell, which goes out like a clarion call to the weary villagers.
