Overall the choices reflect self-aggrandizement, frequently at the expense of others. The revealing characteristic is not only that others may be directly used but that they figure so little in the calculations.\nThe discovery and elaboration of these character types adds a layer of complexity to the traditional psychotic-leader debate, that is, the concern that an extremely disturbed individual might gain access to political power (Lasswell 1964, 223; Tucker 1965, 575—77; Robins 1977a, 14). As suggested in the discussion of the Eagleton case, the structural barriers argument (i.e., that extremely disturbed individuals are not likely to gain political power because they lack the skills to develop and maintain political organization and support) is accurate, but not fully. Therefore, it cannot be persuasively reassuring. If it is true, as Chessick (1985, 8) argues, that “these individuals [narcissistic character types] may obtain high office, and even be elected President of the United States,” then surely there is reason for apprehension. In the material that follows, I will try to make clearer why the case of Gary Hart raises exactly this issue.\nThe 1984 Hart Campaign\nHart’s quest for the presidency and his troubles with regard to the character issue did not begin with the 1988 presidential campaign. Rather, they can be traced to the previous presidential campaign in 1984 when he challenged (for a time successfully) Walter Mondale, who eventually went on to become the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee.7\nWalter Mondale was, by all accounts, the front-runner and seemed well on his way to securing the nomination until Hart scored an upset victory in the New Hampshire primary. By accomplishing the unexpected by a clear (39 percent to 29 percent) but far from sweeping vote, Gary Hart emerged as a credible challenger, a role he continued when he won the Maine caucuses in early March. Almost immediately thereafter, questions began to surface about his character.\nSome of these questions were raised directly by Mondale as part of an effort to recoup his own sagging campaign. For example, in a campaign speech in Boston, Mondale portrayed Hart as a “coldly intellectual man who would bring an unfair and regressive approach to the problems of common people” (New York Times, 6 March 1984, A1). The accusation is interesting for a couple of reasons, in view of subsequent events. First, it raises the issue of emotional distance from others as a characteristic worth "},"document":{"title":"The Psychological Assessment of Presidential Candidates","author":"Stanley A.
