Frequent references to Beijing's long history were accompanied by images of physical remnants of the distant past. The restoration of the past in the creation of a glorious future, termed “restoration nationalism,” was central to official Chinese discourse in the 1990s (Ko 2001). This stands in contrast to the tendency in the second half of the 1980s to blame remnants of traditional Chinese culture, such as Confucianism, for socioeconomic problems (Wang 1996). While the desirability of traditional Chinese values has been questioned within China for a long time, both through intellectual discourse and popular culture, such as the TV series River Elegy (He Sheng), they were constantly evoked and presented as admirable in the material directed at a foreign audience. China's ancient history is not depicted as an earlier stage in the present development process, but as a golden age that illustrates the potential of China as a nation. The future holds the promise for realizing this potential, and is thus as mythical as the past. This resonated with IOC material describing the Olympic Games as a revival of past greatness and virtue. The founder of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, contrasts the anxiety of modern life with the happiness of the past and claims that sport has the ability to return mankind to its origins: “O Sport, pleasure of the Gods, essence of life, you appeared suddenly in the midst of the gray clearing which writhes with the drudgery of modern existence, like the radiant messenger of a past age, when mankind still smiled” (Coubertin [1912] 2002). The IOC often draws upon such mythological imagery in explaining its behavior. The establishment of the so-called Olympic Truce Foundation in 2000, for example, was claimed to be the revival of an ancient Greek tradition.\nIn Beijing's bid material, the present time was described as a period marked by dizzying technological, economic, and social advances. The city is undergoing a transition from underdevelopment to being a modern “world city.” When the IOC Evaluation Commission visited Beijing, the mayor expressed hope that the committee members would see the potential in Beijing as well as its current achievements (China Daily 2001b). The Olympic Games were assigned several roles in this transition process. The first was to speed up the pace of development. As the state news agency Xinhua wrote, “Chinese economists have said that Beijing's successful bid to host the 2008 Olympics will help the city achieve modernization ahead of schedule” (Xinhua 2001c). Such statements reconfirm the Olympic Movement's claim to be a universal\n"},"document":{"title":"Owning the Olympics: Narratives of the New China","author":"Price, Monroe E.; Dayan, Daniel","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":9,"isbn":"9780472024506"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1861,"display_name":"Coubertin, Pierre de"},"id":5270,"ring_next":1780,"ring_prev":1584},{"basket":{"id":1939,"display_name":"International Olympic Committee (IOC) -- and Olympic ideals"},"id":5610,"ring_next":1524,"ring_prev":1620},{"basket":{"id":1946,"display_name":"International Olympic Committee (IOC) -- and visit to Beijing"},"id":5633,"ring_next":1699,"ring_prev":1512}],"localid":"page_158","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/13_chap05.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_158\">","css_selector":"#page_158","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_158\"]"},"next_location_id":1624,"previous_location_id":1622}]
