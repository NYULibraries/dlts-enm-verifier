[{"id":19010,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"71-page_11","content_descriptor":"page 11","text":"Thus, Barney intentionally reverses gendered protocol, making the men the victims of a stream of comments about their physical imperfections while the fact that none of the women writers seems to be afflicted by so much as a cold makes them seem stronger, superior, almost immortal. She discusses the women almost exclusively as artists and has generous praise for most of them. Anna Wickham’s books are “wells of truth” (146).7 Colette is made into a goddess of sorts: she is “on a level with nature and above men” (152). Aurel’s “work is full of splendid finds” (155) and Elisabeth de Gramont “is such a poet … that her quintessence has escaped lesser poets” (161). Barnes has the “extraordinary capacity … to capture social circles which she had every reason not to know” (168). Stein is the “Madame Curie of language. … [S]he has crushed thousands of tons of matter to extract the radium of the word” (172). And Romaine Brooks is no less than “the epitome, the ‘flowery summit’ of a civilization in decline, whose character she was able to capture” (180). The hyperbole is such that the reader will conclude that the least of these women is better than the greatest of the men she knows, though Barney never has to say so directly.\nBecause of this feminist parti pris, Barney allows the women to make harsh remarks about her whereas the men utter only praise. Her introductions by Aurel and Lucie Delarue-Mardrus have the irreverent tone of a roast. Allowing Aurel to introduce her is particularly audacious, since she was originally one of Barney’s few enemies, perhaps because Aurel also ran a salon. Her presence in this book, along with Barney’s kind comments about Charles Maurras and André Rouveyre, both of whom had publicly attacked her, serves to underscore her forgiving and generous nature.8 Aurel says that Barney is “guilty of insolence” and “is hard-to-please.” She’s definitely “not tender” (135). Barney’s wit is “homicidal, it executes without moderation; it kills without discretion” (136). She overlooks the fact that the men have been the recipients of all the bullets. Lucie Delarue-Mardrus adds to the portrait by calling Barney “courageous, scornful, mysterious, subtle, grand, sophistical, sardonic, aristocratic” "},"document":{"title":"Adventures of the Mind","author":"Natalie Clifford Barney, John Spalding Gatton","publisher":"New York University Press","id":71,"isbn":"9780814711774"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":27750,"display_name":"Mme Antoinette Gabrielle Mortier de Faucamberge"},"id":71801,"ring_next":19014,"ring_prev":18931},{"basket":{"id":14844,"display_name":"Barnes, Djuna"},"id":71829,"ring_next":19011,"ring_prev":19005},{"basket":{"id":27833,"display_name":"Brooks, Romaine -- portraits by"},"id":72081,"ring_next":19042,"ring_prev":18958},{"basket":{"id":27851,"display_name":"Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette"},"id":72142,"ring_next":19012,"ring_prev":19001},{"basket":{"id":27731,"display_name":"Delarue-Mardrus -- Lucie"},"id":72213,"ring_next":19014,"ring_prev":19001},{"basket":{"id":27849,"display_name":"Gramont -- Elisabeth de"},"id":72410,"ring_next":19014,"ring_prev":19005},{"basket":{"id":28040,"display_name":"Maurras, Charles"},"id":72723,"ring_next":19015,"ring_prev":19005},{"basket":{"id":28135,"display_name":"Rouveyre, André"},"id":73008,"ring_next":19031,"ring_prev":18906},{"basket":{"id":28147,"display_name":"Salons, Parisian literary -- of Aurel"},"id":73033,"ring_next":19014,"ring_prev":19070},{"basket":{"id":14786,"display_name":"Stein, Gertrude"},"id":73124,"ring_next":19012,"ring_prev":19005},{"basket":{"id":28249,"display_name":"Wickham, Anna"},"id":73370,"ring_next":19014,"ring_prev":18920}],"localid":"page_11","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/intro.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_11\">","css_selector":"#page_11","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_11\"]"},"next_location_id":19011,"previous_location_id":19009}]
