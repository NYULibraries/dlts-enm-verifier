The life of men and womenis so cheap and property is so sacred.—Rose Schneiderman, organizerfor the Women’s Trade UnionLeague, 1911\nThe controversy over James Johnson did not end with the verdict in the criminal case. A bright young lawyer who specialized in worker disability cases had filed a workers’ compensation claim on behalf of Johnson. The lawyer, Ron Glotta, worked in the same law firm as Ken Cockrel and Justin Ravitz and was active in the movement to organize autoworkers. He was a cofounder of the Motor City Labor League, a group of white leftists whose purpose was to organize among white workers and to support the actions of the black radicals in the League of Revolutionary Black Workers, DRUM, ELDRUM, and other such alternative union groupings. The Motor City Labor League recognized that black workers who spoke out for radical change were isolated by the established union and were attacked by management. They felt it was necessary for whites to give ideological and concrete support to blacks who were leading the struggle for fundamental change. They believed that if the demands of the black workers were satisfied the result would benefit all workers. In this context of racial solidarity, Glotta became one of the attorneys for the League of Revolutionary Black Workers and offered his skills in the field of workers’ compensation and labor law.\n"},"document":{"title":"Black Rage Confronts the Law","author":"Paul Harris","publisher":"New York University","id":95,"isbn":"9780814735923"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":39935,"display_name":"Glotta, Ron"},"id":98753,"ring_next":26906,"ring_prev":26906},{"basket":{"id":39966,"display_name":"Johnson, James, Jr. -- workers' compensation case"},"id":98801,"ring_next":26793,"ring_prev":26793},{"basket":{"id":40036,"display_name":"Motor City Labor League"},"id":98905,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":40073,"display_name":"Schneiderman, Rose"},"id":98957,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_112","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch05.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_112\">","css_selector":"#page_112","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_112\"]"},"next_location_id":26902,"previous_location_id":26900}]
