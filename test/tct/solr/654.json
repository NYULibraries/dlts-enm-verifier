The principle of universality and affordability implied pressure on the government to keep the cost down, but as a universal service the fee was set high enough to provide comprehensive programming in all genres. In this sense, the change into media-neutral fees that also cover personal computer and smartphone ownership, or even specific taxes such as seen in Finland and Germany (Moe 2012b), should be seen as an extension of the traditional license fee.\nHowever, the license fee also has another dimension, that of safeguarding editorial freedom, what we have termed the second pillar of the Media Welfare State. In principle, the license fee safeguards the autonomy of broadcasters from both market pressures and political pressures. Although public broadcasters pay increasing attention to popularity in the market, their financial return is only based on the number of set holders (close to the entire population) and not on the ratings of their programs or the demographics of their viewers. The license fee is also understood as a way of safeguarding the broadcasters from government pressure in controversial political questions; they should be self-funded rather than being forced to reflect the views of the government of the day (e.g., Moe and Mjøs 2013).\nThe continued existence of the fee in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, along with the introduction of a universal and comprehensive funding scheme in Finland, testifies to the continued legitimacy of public service broadcasters and the commitment among key stakeholders to keep up both the funding level and the autonomous position of the broadcasters. In this case the stakeholders are the state, political parties, the government, and the license fee-paying population. The equal and secure funding has been discussed, but not attacked outright as in many other countries. The license fee has been retained in Britain, but has been severely criticized; for example, Margaret Thatcher, prime minister of the United Kingdom, 1979–90, allegedly saw the license fee as the symbol of “all that was wrong with British television and, indeed, with Britain more generally” (King 1998, 283–84). In the United States, public broadcasting has historically been starved of public funding (Smith 1998, 53). At the European level, there has been a recurring conflict between private and public service broadcasters over whether the license fee constitutes a form of illegal subsidy (Levy 1999; Mortensen 2005), and the license fee has in many countries—such as Cyprus, Portugal, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Belgium—been replaced with some form of taxation, in some cases leading to a reduced level of funding. While it is too early to evaluate the outcome of the recent Finnish changes, the Nordic approach nevertheless stands out as distinct: instead of undermining the prospects for public service funding in a new environment, the intention has been to create more “future proof” setups.\n"},"document":{"title":"The Media Welfare State: Nordic Media in the Digital Era","author":"Syvertsen, Trine; Enli, Gunn; Mjøs, Ole J.; Moe, Hallvard","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":3,"isbn":"9780472120314"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":10069,"display_name":"BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation)"},"id":825,"ring_next":656,"ring_prev":646},{"basket":{"id":242,"display_name":"demographics"},"id":869,"ring_next":700,"ring_prev":632},{"basket":{"id":259,"display_name":"Europe -- and public service broadcasting"},"id":962,"ring_next":657,"ring_prev":651},{"basket":{"id":315,"display_name":"Netherlands"},"id":1334,"ring_next":674,"ring_prev":650},{"basket":{"id":333,"display_name":"Norwegian Public Service Broadcaster (NRK) -- and editorial/press freedom"},"id":1448,"ring_next":669,"ring_prev":646},{"basket":{"id":343,"display_name":"public service broadcasting -- and editorial independence"},"id":1552,"ring_next":669,"ring_prev":646},{"basket":{"id":344,"display_name":"public service broadcasting -- and license fee"},"id":1559,"ring_next":669,"ring_prev":652},{"basket":{"id":346,"display_name":"public service broadcasting -- and television programming"},"id":1572,"ring_next":661,"ring_prev":647},{"basket":{"id":370,"display_name":"United Kingdom, Great Britain"},"id":1734,"ring_next":660,"ring_prev":652},{"basket":{"id":372,"display_name":"universalism"},"id":1778,"ring_next":656,"ring_prev":652}],"localid":"page_79","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter04.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_79\">","css_selector":"#page_79","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_79\"]"},"next_location_id":655,"previous_location_id":653}]
