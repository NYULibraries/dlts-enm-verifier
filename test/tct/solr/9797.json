[{"id":9797,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"40-page_139","content_descriptor":"page 139","text":"FC2, UCL, and ABR at ISU are thoroughly mixed; the dominant mood of the place runs from pride and joy to cautious pessimism. In part that’s because their writers and their enterprises are so wildly various, the writers themselves ranging from the renowned to the unknown, the brilliant to the boring. But it’s also because the cultural weather is so volatile: both enterprises are very heavily dependent on the continuing kindness of strangers, and though many strangers have been kind indeed, O’Brien admits that the Dalkey Archive simply would not exist if not for the National Endowment for the Arts and granting agencies like the Lila Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund. “The Review might be able to make it,” O’Brien says, adding, “just barely. But the press wouldn’t stand a chance.”\nI spoke with O’Brien in 1995, and his words now sound chilling to me in 1997, as FC2 has become the stick with which Peter Hoekstra is trying to flog the NEA. On the other hand, as I think back to Richard Grossman’s reading and that eerie feeling of doing the wine and cheese routine on the grounds where scores of Dickensian waifs once timidly held out their bowls for gruel, I wonder whether there isn’t some reason for hope. Despite the shrinking of the imprints, the intransigence of Republicans, and the question of whether Normal, Illinois, can keep up all this manic publishing activity—despite all this, there’s something piquant, even encouraging, about the thought of orphanages being converted into Units for Contemporary Literature somewhere in the heart of the heart of the country: few cultural developments, I think, could run more directly contrary to the Zeitgeist of the Age of Newt. Perhaps, indeed, that is the real reason the nonprofit presses of Normal now find themselves under assault.\nNOTES\n1. Individual Fiction Collective writers have, however, fared better in academic criticism than the collective as a whole. Sukenick and Federman are often cited alongside Coover and Pynchon as 1970s postmodernists; Major and Dixon are sometimes mentioned in the same breath as Ishmael Reed. To date, however, I have only found one article devoted to the Fiction Collective qua Fiction Collective (see Quartermain).\n"},"document":{"title":"The Employment of English","author":"Michael Bérubé","publisher":"New York University Press","id":40,"isbn":"9780814713013"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":15036,"display_name":"Grossman, Richard"},"id":43578,"ring_next":9777,"ring_prev":9790},{"basket":{"id":15049,"display_name":"Hoekstra, Peter"},"id":43599,"ring_next":9772,"ring_prev":9772},{"basket":{"id":3831,"display_name":"National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)"},"id":43807,"ring_next":9834,"ring_prev":9772},{"basket":{"id":15193,"display_name":"O'Brien, John"},"id":43839,"ring_next":9796,"ring_prev":9796}],"localid":"page_139","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch05.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_139\">","css_selector":"#page_139","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_139\"]"},"next_location_id":9798,"previous_location_id":9796}]
