If ever I begin to consider our family as unfortunate, I need only glance at the three plastic tubs of our family history, intact and safe, and think of our former neighbor's photographs, water-soaked and mildewed, scattered across their lawn in an attempt to salvage some shreds from thirty years of history.\nObviously, our personal losses were relatively limited. The second floor did not flood, so our rented townhouse can be interpreted as having been either half full of floodwater or half empty depending on how the day is going. “Well, you're lucky,” more than one person told us after they heard that we had only rented the townhouse, so these conversations often ended on this chipper note. Yes, we knew the neighborhood was a flood zone, and we couldn't afford to purchase a home anyway, so we had remained renters.

Since we lacked flood insurance, we received $2,500 from our renter's policy before State Farm dropped us. (The appeal process remains unsuccessful.) The payout barely covered our hotel and travel expenses before we were able to benefit from the kindness of family and friends. The Red Cross had proved unwilling to help us on several different occasions, so we ended up relying on both sets of our retired parents for immediate financial support. In returning to the city in late 2005, we had felt relieved, understanding that the rent subsidy program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would shield us from the full impact of post-Katrina rents for as long as eighteen months. Accustomed to paying $1,100 in rent per month in August 2005, four months later we began to pay $2,000 for a dilapidated house without heat.5 After providing two rental assistance payments, yet\n"},"document":{"title":"Civic Engagement in the Wake of Katrina","author":"Amy Koritz and George J.
