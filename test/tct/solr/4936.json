The lesson: don't defend lost ground; at times there is no going back; making decisions to insure that one does not consider a return is a good move. Andreesen's point was that old print-based media forms are dead, and it does no good to try and reenvision them for the twenty-first century.

Rather than providing the book with a digital facelift for twenty-first-century scholarly communication, academics should move past book-based biases—which structure scholarly communications, and instead imagine and execute digitally born scholarly forms—which leverage the evolving digital-media landscape.\nThis is not to suggest that we actually engage in book burning. Instead, we need to burn our love affair with books, and that out of reverence to the book, we stop treating it as the only, or even primary, means of scholarly communication.

My fear is that academics are making the same mistake. Granted, this analogy is not perfect—there are contours and shapes, and nuance and details that matter here. They are not a direct equivalence, but the\n"},"document":{"title":"Hacking the Academy: New Approaches to Scholarship and Teaching from Digital Humanities","author":"Cohen, Daniel J.; Scheinfeldt, Tom","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":24,"isbn":"9780472029471"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_15","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter03.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_15\">","css_selector":"#page_15","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_15\"]"},"next_location_id":4937,"previous_location_id":4935}]
