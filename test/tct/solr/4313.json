In writing this paper, you should think about such issues as the interpretive power of the article; the accessibility of the prose; the level of factual detail; the visual layout of the information; and any other issues that strike you as relevant. Turn in copies of the print articles (with citations noted on the copy) with your paper.\n \nIn class, we discuss the merits of the various tertiary sources at their disposal. My students tend to notice things like the convenience of the Internet over the library, how long entries are, how much detail they offer, whether they answer the particular questions that they had in mind, and whether they are comprehensive in scope.\nYet no student has hit what I consider to be the crux of the matter: how well the tertiary sources convey their arguments.\n“Whoa!” someone might reply here, “Encyclopedias are not supposed to have arguments. They are supposed to convey factual information without bias.” Wikipedia enshrines this claim with its philosophy that all articles must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV).11 When we seek out an encyclopedia article on a topic, we are (theoretically) looking for a basic introduction to the topic, an introduction that is balanced. We are not looking for the cutting edge of a scholarly debate. If we wanted argument, we would go to the monographic literature on the topic. Among the virtues of Wikipedia (and other tertiary sources) is the ease of locating just that quick hit of information that we need to write a lecture.\nI suggest, however, that even in a brief encyclopedia entry, argument—whether coherent or not—is unavoidable. In his article “A Place for Stories,” environmental historian William Cronon explains the impossibility of NPOV. Cronon conducts a thought experiment: describe the history of the Great Plains. Cronon argues that the only “pure chronicle would have included every event that ever occurred on the Great Plains, no matter how large or small, so that a colorful sunset in September 1623 or a morning milking of cows on a farm near Leavenworth in 1897 would occupy just as prominent a place as the destruction of the bison herds or the 1930s dust storms.” Choosing which details to include and exclude is implicitly an act of argument, prioritizing one facet of an experience over another.12 Similarly, in his essay “The Wikiblitz” in this volume, Shawn Graham suggests that NPOV is itself a point of view that enables certain kinds of rhetoric but not others.\nEditors of scholarly encyclopedias recognize that their authors are making arguments. I learned this multiple times as my own encyclopedic career unfolded. My first professional publication was an encyclopedia entry\n"},"document":{"title":"Writing History in the Digital Age","author":"Dougherty, Jack; Nawrotzki, Kristen","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":21,"isbn":"9780472029914"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_125","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter09.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_125\">","css_selector":"#page_125","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_125\"]"},"next_location_id":4314,"previous_location_id":4312}]
