While most Communists still condemned Einstein for rejecting “scientific materialism,” Herberg insisted that both Marxism and the theory of relativity were scientifically correct. As a radical Jew, moreover, Herberg hailed Freud, as he did Marx and Einstein, as a modern prophet. “The world of socialism—to which nothing human is alien and which cherishes every genuine manifestation of the human spirit,” he wrote during the 1930s, “lays a wreath of homage on the grave of Sigmund Freud.”\nFirst signs of Herberg’s eventual disenchantment with orthodox Marxism came already in 1920, when he, Bertram Wolfe, and other young intellectuals and labor organizers joined a group, headed by Jay Lovestone, that split off from the main Communist party within the American party leadership. Lovestone, an American supporter of the Soviet theoretician Nicolai Bukharin, had, like Bukharin, advocated more autonomy for national Communist parties from control by the Communist party of the USSR. In 1929, Stalin struck back by demoting Bukharin and ousting Lovestone and his followers from leadership of the American movement. After breaking with the official party in 1929, Herberg became a staff member and then editor of the Lovestonite opposition paper, Workers Age, many of whose contributors would later become bitter anti-Stalinists.\nAs the 1930s proceeded, Herberg became disenchanted with his Marxist faith. The grotesque Stalinist purges, the Communist betrayal of the Popular Front on the battlefields of Spain during the Spanish Civil War, the Russian invasion of Finland, and the Stalin-Hitler Nonaggression Pact of 1939 all contributed to his growing disillusionment. The Moscow trials, Herberg maintained, indicated the barbarous measures to which Stalin would resort to suppress all resistance to his bureaucratic rule within Russia. For Herberg, as for so many ex-Marxists of his generation, the cynical, opportunistic Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement of 1939 dispelled any remaining belief that “only a socialist government can defeat totalitarianism.” His final break with orthodox Marxism, which came in 1939, involved no mere change in political loyalties or repudiation of the political radicalism of his youth.
