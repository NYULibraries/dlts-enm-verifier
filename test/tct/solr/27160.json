When I encourage him to tell me why he doesn’t discuss his troubles with his male peers, Malcolm says:\nLike ’cause I feel that what I got to say, everybody can’t handle it or really wouldn’t understand it, you know. They’ll sit there—they’ll take it as if I’m talking about the sports game or something. Like, if I were to talk about my sister, and they’ll just change it up. Like, “Yeah, how are the Bulls doing?” You know?\nMalcolm’s thoughts about communicating with his peers this year are more complicated than he had indicated to me earlier in his interview. He wants to talk to others about what is happening in his life, but only to those people who will listen and understand him. While he seems to believe that I, as his interviewer, can “handle it,” he doesn’t hold such faith in his male peers.\nMalcolm states, as he did in previous interviews, that he doesn’t have a best or close friend this year:\nI had a couple [of friends] like once when I was real young, around ten, and then when I lived out—and then me and this dude got real close, we was cool. But right now, nobody really ’cause it seems that as I’ve grown, you know, everybody just talk behind your back and stuff, you know. So I just let it go because it seems like no people that can hold—well, not no people, but the people that I’ve been meeting can hold up to their actions. Like you know … something might’ve happened like between me and a person where other people felt that we shouldn’t even be friends no more. So they sit there and talk about me to that person while I’m not around or something. And then that person will just talk about me too, you know, whatever, ’cause you know all throughout my neighborhood, I always hear, “He talks about you, he says this or he says that.” … So I just don’t really bother with it, you know, trying to make best friends.\nAlthough he had a close friend when he was young, Malcolm currently believes, like most of the other boys in the study, that his male peers will betray his trust. He, consequently, does not have a close or best friend and has given up on trying to find one (chapter 5 is focused on this theme in the boys’ interviews).\nMalcolm explicitly tells me that he does not tell his male peers when he is angry:\n"},"document":{"title":"Everyday Courage","author":"Niobe Way","publisher":"New York University Press","id":96,"isbn":"9780814793398"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":40202,"display_name":"Anger -- suppression of"},"id":99132,"ring_next":27172,"ring_prev":27146},{"basket":{"id":40363,"display_name":"Friends -- loss of, in adolescence"},"id":99359,"ring_next":27206,"ring_prev":27227}],"localid":"page_67","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch03.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_67\">","css_selector":"#page_67","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_67\"]"},"next_location_id":27161,"previous_location_id":27159}]
