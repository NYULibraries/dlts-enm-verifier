Consequently, local dynamics of power and place-specific policies must be acknowledged when considering the definition and designation of slums.\n      Remaining mindful of these concerns I contend that examinations of slums and slum policy can help illuminate local power arrangements rather than obscuring them.3 Throughout this book I use the word “slum” to refer to the generally substandard settlements in which large segments of the urban poor live and work throughout the global south. These settlements are typically informal, illegal, or quasilegal and are supported by loose networks of residents, politicians, community leaders and crime bosses, social workers, police, and municipal officials. Although the details of their emergence and transformations differ across political, cultural, and institutional space, slums can be broadly attributed to failures or gaps in formal service provision. When markets and governments both fail to provide adequate housing to low-wage workers and their families, then slums proliferate. The concept of a slum is broad enough to accommodate the diverse forms this failure can take, and empirical examinations of them can help reveal the political and economic causes of failure.\n      But more important, and also more simply, I employ and engage with the term “slum” because it is used so frequently, and unselfconsciously, in my field site. The slum, and its local equivalent jhopadpati, has social and political significance in Dharavi and Mumbai. Despite the diverse economic conditions, forms of housing, and legal arrangements found within, the term signifies a space outside of, but tightly intertwined with, formal governance institutions and property markets. Slums exist because of these formal institutions, not in spite of them, and must be understood in relation to them.\n      Given this perspective, I accept the increasingly controversial claim that Dharavi is a slum, and I employ the term throughout the book. Because of its institutional density—including a multitude of schools, hospitals, pharmacies, restaurants and bars, clothing shops, electronics stores, vegetable markets, and dry goods shops—many people who know Dharavi prefer not to use the term “slum” to describe it.4 Aneesh Shankar, in fact, never described Dharavi to me as a slum, although I am not sure how conscious the term’s absence was from his language. He explained to me, “Just like Mumbai is the heart of India, Dharavi is the heart of Mumbai,5. . . Everything is convenient from here. From the start of birth to the end of life, you can stay within five minutes of here.” Despite the completeness and "},"document":{"title":"The Durable Slum","author":"Liza Weinstein","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","id":108,"isbn":"9780816683109"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_10","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/ump-weinstein-0011.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"p10\" class=\"page\" />","css_selector":"#p10","xpath":"a[@id=\"p10\"]"},"next_location_id":29787,"previous_location_id":29785}]
