The conditions for the success of an imported program or series depends in part a least on domestic factors, ranging from the established local conventions of broadcasting to scheduling decisions that influence the size of the available audience.\n4. The attempt to organize a political struggle around opposition to cultural imperialism took the concrete form of a struggle for a New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO). A great deal of effort went into attempting to influence UNESCO, and into building alliances with the representatives of many unsavory despots who were only too happy to curb the media and impose cultural uniformity on their unfortunate subjects. NWICO became embroiled in the Cold War and it went down to defeat along with the Stalinist allies it had accumulated in its attempt to win acceptance (Hamelink, 1997).\nOne could both amplify and expand this list of objections: taken together, the evidence against the concept of cultural imperialism advanced by Schiller is simply overwhelming. The new orthodoxy in the study of international communication began from the complexity both of media production and of audience behavior. There are many studies documenting the production and circulation of television programs, cinema films, and other artifacts originating far outside the range of Hollywood. Similarly, there are detailed studies of the ways in which audiences, or at least sections of audiences, within the developed world utilize these non-U.S. media artifacts to construct their own cultural frameworks and identities. Underlying this plethora of studies has been one or other variant of theories of globalization, which replace the concept of imperialism as the organizing element in this framework of thought. This is a notoriously protean group of concepts but we can note one central element which is common to many of the variants: it systematically marginalizes the role of the state.\nThis marginalization is clearly present in the pervasive slogans of “the global and the local,” “glocalization,” “think global, act local,” and so on. The missing term in all of these formulations is precisely the state. Unless the term “local” really means “national,” as indeed it does when one interrogates many of these celebrations of the “local,” then the claim is that the poles of contemporary cultural (or indeed almost any other) life are to be located regionally, and thus “below” the level of the state, and globally “above” the level of the state. Unlike the national, neither the local nor the global are equipped with the full apparatus of state power that coerces and regulates social life, culturally and economically. On the contrary, they are much more the field of the free play of economic competition.\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1854,"display_name":"Cold War"},"id":6629,"ring_next":2068,"ring_prev":1957},{"basket":{"id":277,"display_name":"globalization"},"id":7054,"ring_next":2049,"ring_prev":2043},{"basket":{"id":2135,"display_name":"Hollywood films"},"id":7171,"ring_next":2049,"ring_prev":2039},{"basket":{"id":1257,"display_name":"imperialism"},"id":7243,"ring_next":2050,"ring_prev":2043},{"basket":{"id":2320,"display_name":"Media production"},"id":7605,"ring_next":2112,"ring_prev":2003},{"basket":{"id":2347,"display_name":"New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO)"},"id":7834,"ring_next":2058,"ring_prev":1934},{"basket":{"id":2184,"display_name":"Schiller, Herbert I."},"id":8096,"ring_next":2050,"ring_prev":2045},{"basket":{"id":2429,"display_name":"UNESCO"},"id":8239,"ring_next":2152,"ring_prev":2046}],"localid":"page_161","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter08.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_161\">","css_selector":"#page_161","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_161\"]"},"next_location_id":2049,"previous_location_id":2047}]
