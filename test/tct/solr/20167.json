Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, & such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government.” Like Old Testament prophets, Whigs were not responsible for the consequences of defending their freedoms, only irresponsible if they failed to do so.\nClosely connected to discussions of duty in late-eighteenth-century thought was the notion of virtue.84 Much of the logic as well as the language of these discussions was borrowed from classical sources, notably Aristotle and Cicero. Virtue for Aristotle consisted in the pleasure derived from acting in accordance with the good. Although the end is pleasure, virtue is not passionate self-indulgence, but exists in that sphere where right reason and the pleasurable coincide.85 It is the rational capacity that distinguishes human beings from lesser creatures, and the failure to exercise that capacity was counted a fall into “effeminacy.” Aristotle held defects in government, particularly tyranny, to be symptomatic of such failures, the overwhelming of the rational by the appetitive, the life of ease which makes easy prey of the polis. 86 Consequently, it was possible to read the pain of slavery as a failure of virtue, for only those who had not the virtue of rational deliberation were by nature fitted to be slaves.87 The virtue of the good man is necessarily connected in Aristotle’s view to the virtue of the citizen of the perfect state,88 and Aristotle connects the right to rebel with virtue, that is, the exercise of right reason.89\nBorrowing classical ideas of virtue, the Whigs were able to present rebellion as an act of virtue, meaning not only that the act was praiseworthy, but that failure to act would constitute moral degeneracy. Robert Bellah goes so far as to argue that virtue “was the organizing center of that initial Revolution in the minds of men that I have identified with the civil religion, the very spirit of the Declaration of Independence.”90 Clearly finding his model in classical Rome, “Brutus” proclaimed,\nThe prevailing principle of our government is, virtue. If we would be happy, we must be more attentive to it than we hitherto have been. By that only can liberty be preserved; and on the preservation of liberty depends our happiness. By virtue, I here mean a love for our country, which makes us pursue with alacrity, such measures as tend to its preservation; and cheerfully resist the temptations of ease and luxury, with which liberty is incompatible. For luxury and idleness bring on a general depravation of manners, which sets us loose from all the restraints of both private and public virtue, and diverts our thoughts from examining the behavior and politics of artful and "},"document":{"title":"The Prophetic Tradition and Radical Rhetoric in America","author":"James Darsey","publisher":"New York University Press","id":75,"isbn":"9780814718766"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":30269,"display_name":"Aristotle -- on virtue"},"id":76838,"ring_next":20148,"ring_prev":20148},{"basket":{"id":30289,"display_name":"Bellah, Robert N."},"id":76878,"ring_next":20244,"ring_prev":20140},{"basket":{"id":22365,"display_name":"\"Brutus\""},"id":76935,"ring_next":14327,"ring_prev":14374},{"basket":{"id":30365,"display_name":"Cicero -- and virtue"},"id":76999,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":19846,"display_name":"Declaration of Independence"},"id":77158,"ring_next":20169,"ring_prev":20166},{"basket":{"id":30547,"display_name":"freedom -- and duty in American tradition"},"id":77290,"ring_next":20205,"ring_prev":20321},{"basket":{"id":31032,"display_name":"slavery, and U.S. Constitution -- Whig conception"},"id":78109,"ring_next":20161,"ring_prev":20166},{"basket":{"id":31098,"display_name":"virtue -- in American Revolution"},"id":78199,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_49","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch03.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_49\">","css_selector":"#page_49","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_49\"]"},"next_location_id":20168,"previous_location_id":20166}]
