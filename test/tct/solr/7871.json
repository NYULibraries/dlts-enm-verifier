The Horneyan typology helps us to see how certain traits and behaviors are related to each other within a psychological system, but once we have identified a person’s predominant solution, we must not assume the presence of all the characteristics Horney ascribes to that solution. It is also important to remember, as Horney observes, that “although people tending toward the same main solution have characteristic similarities, they may differ widely with regard to [their] level of human qualities, gifts, or achievements” (1950, 191). The situation is further complicated by the fact that people experience inner conflicts and display behaviors, traits, and beliefs that belong to more than one solution. Quoting William James to the effect that “‘most cases are mixed cases’” and that “‘we should not treat our classifications with too much respect,’” Horney concludes: “It would be more nearly correct to speak of directions of development than of types” (1950, 191).\nIf we forget these qualifications, we are liable to put people into categories instead of grasping their individuality, and our analysis will be little more than a reductive labeling. Horney allows for infinite variations and combinations of defenses and recognizes other components of the personality as well. In a brief description, her theory seems highly schematic, but when properly employed it is quite flexible."},"document":{"title":"Imagined Human Beings","author":"Bernard J.
