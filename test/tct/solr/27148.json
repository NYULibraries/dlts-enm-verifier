However, he has taken on the caretaker role and he wants Mike to know this.\nIn response to a question about whether or not he has a best or close friend this year, Malcolm says:\nJust my girlfriend really. I be chilling with her, but besides that I’m getting tired of being crowded really. I like hanging out but it just gets boring when you, like, do the same things so much. So when, like, people say, you know, “Why don’t you come out anymore,” I don’t feel like just going out, sitting on the corner or nothing.\nWhat exactly do you mean by being crowded?\nWell, it could just be one person. But sometimes, that one person just get aggravating. Not what he says and stuff, it’s just that he’s being—that he’s there. ’Cause it’s just most of the time I like to be alone, you know, just me and my dark side. I like music a lot. So I just buy a lot of albums and stuff, but I don’t like people always around me and stuff.\nWhile Mike asks Malcolm about “friends,” Malcolm responds by referring either to his girlfriend or to “people” (last year it was “associates”). Like last year, Malcolm is seemingly frustrated with his male peers and does not believe he has a close male friend.\nMalcolm mentions, at a later point in his interview, that spending time with his male peers may not only be “aggravating” but also dangerous:\nSo like I’d rather just go [out] by myself if anything’s going to happen it’s gonna happen with me alone. Therefore, I won’t have to bring nobody else into it. You know, ’cause when you’re hanging with a gang, there might be a dude that’s hanging with you that got a beef with these people over here. And then all of a sudden you getting stabbed up or you in a fight or something or arrested over that.\nRemarkably, Malcolm’s peers do not provide him with a sense of security but rather with a grave sense of peril. Keeping to himself, however, has not protected Malcolm from all threats of violence. He was recently shot at by a gang of boys while walking his dog. Since these situations frighten him, he tries to stay “out of trouble” and not make any “enemies.” For Malcolm, there are dangers to being alone as well as being with his peers. He is caught in an environment that has no clear route toward safety.\n"},"document":{"title":"Everyday Courage","author":"Niobe Way","publisher":"New York University Press","id":96,"isbn":"9780814793398"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":40274,"display_name":"Danger -- and male friends"},"id":99230,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":40354,"display_name":"Friends -- attitudes toward"},"id":99344,"ring_next":27159,"ring_prev":27138},{"basket":{"id":40397,"display_name":"Girlfriend(s) -- as friends"},"id":99417,"ring_next":27149,"ring_prev":27208},{"basket":{"id":40714,"display_name":"Violence -- attitudes toward"},"id":99904,"ring_next":27164,"ring_prev":27135}],"localid":"page_55","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch03.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_55\">","css_selector":"#page_55","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_55\"]"},"next_location_id":27149,"previous_location_id":27147}]
