Most teachers rely on someone else’s definition of the classics to entice students into appreciating poetry. Students, faced with a poem wearing waistcoat and spats, feel both locked out and out of place, much like kids schussed from the room when the parents start the adult talk they’re not privy to. Yes, the classics ought to be taught, if only to extend the culture’s historical perspective. But to appreciate the classics, whatever they are, given the term’s problematic canonical notion, students must acquire aesthetic sophistication. That sophistication must be ably taught and willingly learned over time, as one would a piano concerto or a basketball three-point shot. This is not to say that contemporary poems amount to “Chopsticks” renditions or breakaway layups. The point is rather that students encountering a work bound up in their own historical moment are more willing to exert the intellectual and emotional energy necessary to inhabit fully a poem’s experience.\nTeachers’ tendency to offer up the Fireside Poets reflects their own preoccupation with didactic meaning. Like many, teachers blanch at indeterminacy and at endings that don’t end. How does one put that on the test? As a result, a good number of teachers prefer poems to click open like a box so their contents may be categorized and accounted for, item by stolid item, as if poems were material not linguistic and experiential things. To do so is to thwart poetry’s innate lyricism and orality, its roots in music. To do so, perhaps unwittingly, is to promote poetry as means of moral betterment. To do so also invokes the Great Age of Newspaper Verse, where the genteel poem’s primary purpose could be reduced to the white-bearded phrase prodessare et delectare, “to teach and to delight.” This matter is especially problematic for teenagers, most of whom run in fear of sermonizing, whether it issues from the pulpit, the home, or the schoolroom. None wishes to become complicit in the status quo, especially one liberally spritzed with thee’s and thou’s and snappy aphoristic advice. Teenagers are least apt to warm to Longfellow’s fireside verse, no matter Longfellow’s birthday was once a schoolkid’s national holiday.\nIn my experience visiting middle and high school classrooms all over Illinois, something catastrophic happens to kids between seventh and ninth grades. The event stands tragic for the kids and ominous for those of us who believe poetry offers a lifetime of humanizing pleasures.
