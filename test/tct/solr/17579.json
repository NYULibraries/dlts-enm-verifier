Vera stared him down without moving and pretended to be asleep with her eyes opened. She often practiced this, sometimes going ten minutes without blinking. The trick was to force her eyes open so widely that the pain reached down into her chest and became a part of her breathing, and then her eyes would refuse to close. Thomas could not distract himself from her insistent, meticulous gaze. She scoured his body without even touching him. She reached down his throat and squeezed his neck apart from the inside. She held him in her arms, rocking him gently. He believed that she was dead.\nThen she blinked, and he noticed the sleepies in the corners of her eyelids. He realized that he was confused, and reoriented himself by thinking of her name. Vera, he repeated to himself again and again. He began free-associating with numbers, trying to get his mind to focus on the number of its choice. Long ago, he had realized that 22 was his most amicable number, and his mind kept returning to it, seeking familiarity. He did some quick figuring, using his own variation on the Hebrew-alphabet system, and was able to numerologize Vera’s name into 8, 7, 5, and 1. In his head, he added the numbers and came up with 22, and it all made sense to him.\nHe sat up awkwardly, and Vera did the same, still holding her broom handle in obvious readiness. She believed that if she imitated his actions as if he were looking in a mirror, he would not realize that she was awake.\n"},"document":{"title":"Indentation and Other Stories","author":"Joe Schall","publisher":"New York University Press","id":65,"isbn":"9780814779170"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_163","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch08.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_163\">","css_selector":"#page_163","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_163\"]"},"next_location_id":17580,"previous_location_id":17578}]
