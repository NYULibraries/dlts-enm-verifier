As urban scholar Gary Miller explains, “Proposition 13 revealed in bolder outlines the subtle redistributional conflict involved in the earlier incorporation movement. Both Proposition 13 and the incorporation of the Lakewood Plan cities allowed home owners to enjoy the benefits of increasing property valuation without suffering the proportionally increasing cost of property taxation. And the costs were paid by low-income groups and minorities.”89 Zoning, incorporation, and selective provision of services enabled the privatization of wealth gained from the city’s spatial divides, what Miller calls the “social nonresponsibility of property owners.”90 Just as property rights trumped open housing in 1964, they would trump health rights in 1978.\nPeace, Failed Tax Reforms, and Alternative Metropolitan Futures\nIn the early 1980s, when the full effects of Proposition 13 austerity were becoming evident, the Los Angeles chapter of the Medical Committee for Human Rights questioned: “Why are our cities being forced to choose between economic collapse and eliminating needed services? Over the years, the cities have relied on the banks to finance their debts, enriching the bankers with interest paid from our taxes … . The people who built our cities with their sweat and blood are being discarded for the profits of the rich.”91 Could the 1978 property tax revolt have turned out differently and how might this have changed the shape of Los Angeles and the nation’s cities? George Wiley envisioned his newly founded organization, Movement for Economic Justice, as a vehicle to “coalesce a majority of the American electorate around an agenda of basic economic reform,” that would be “fundamental to the survival if not the liberation of Blacks.”92 This movement would “counter [Nixon’s] repressive budget” and advocate for property tax reform.93\n"},"document":{"title":"Health Rights Are Civil Rights","author":"Jenna M.
