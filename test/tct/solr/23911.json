The text thus seems emphatically able to encourage idealization, but oddly unable to control the form of the idealization it engenders.\nIn my attempt to make sense of this situation, I suggest that this text, like many similar ones, mobilizes a fluidity of narcissistic ambitions. If idealization is funded by narcissistic energy, then texts must release and rebind the narcissistic energy to promote idealization. Literary rhetoric depends on its ability to release libidinal narcissistic energy. But because this release is so central to the literary experience, literary texts become self-defeating if they seek to rigidly control libido and insist on a didactic rhetoric of mastery. Literary texts offer readers many positions of mastery; but they resist any wholesale narcissistic investment in such totalizing positions of mastery.\nIn reading Heart of Darkness I have sought to describe the narcissistic structure of the author and the narcissistic structure of a reader. An understanding of narcissism helps bridge the gap between the apparent pleasures of reading and the changes in self-awareness these pleasures enable. Initially this seems to be another paradox. Narcissism appears to be a force most dedicated to defending a static self-structure. However, as Kohut and Kernberg show us, narcissism is an energy that—in driving the self to exist more fully in order to master all situations—is also involved with self-change. And the self’s imaginative potential for change is protean. Narcissism can keep self-boundaries fluid, encouraging us to identify with people we want to be like, with people we do not fully understand, with situations that are exotic and inexplicable. Narcissism explains the mechanisms and pleasures of self-conflict and our curiously obsessive investments in often distant social conflict.\nAs we appreciate the narcissistic forces at work in textual response, we can examine relationships between narcissism and literary theory. It seems that the authority of theory is always a form of narcissism. No theory ever offers enough evidence to justify its policing of thought and imagination. We choose theories not because they are true, but because we become caught within their imagined conflicts; we become absorbed by their ability to resolve conflicts according to prescribed methods. We find a compelling resonance between the objects we want to believe and the things theories describe. We are drawn toward a vision of mastery that theories offer.\nI would hope good theories offer us the subtle rewards of more "},"document":{"title":"Narcissism and the Literary Libido","author":"Marshall W.
