The point here is not that candidates shouldn’t prepare for public events but that spontaneous and prepared behaviors have different meanings and significance. There are good reasons for wanting to know how a candidate responds to the unexpected, since political events cannot always be anticipated, yet the development of debates for the past few election campaigns and incidents like the furiously rehearsed “spontaneous” interview between Dan Rather and George Bush suggest that citizens are getting fewer opportunities to make these assessments.\n6. In discussing the possibility of assessing national leaders at a distance, Wedge, who performed such analyses for the Central Intelligence Agency, notes, “In my experience, almost all leaders of major nations are men of strong character—hence, the personality assessment of them is less problematical than for the common run of man” (1968, 25).\n7. It is possible that the latter questions arose in part because of Bush’s long history in positions that required him to avoid public exposure and controversy (e.g., director of the CIA, ambassador to China). It may also have developed from Bush’s leadership style of working intensively, but privately, to mobilize and build agreement. Whatever its origins, the public’s view of Bush was that of a slightly effete “preppy” with a quiet, noncharismatic leadership style.\n8. The question here, it is important to note, was not whether Bush was a “tough character” but whether he was a character who could be tough.\n9. A political campaign requires citizens to evaluate and respond to the political persona as well as to the leader as a person. Part of the task of a presidential candidate is publicly to give voice to a political self, that part of a candidate’s personal and political identity which expresses (among other things) a vision of the future as well as plans for the present. There is nothing inherently sinister in this. The candidate’s political self has its own developmental line as well as its own personal and political functions. The elaboration of a professional identity and style is a normal part of adult development, and the presentation of a political persona is a legitimate part of the leadership selection process. It therefore deserves consideration on its own grounds.\nBut assessment problems arise here because although character will always find expression in a candidate’s political style and identity, the two are not synonymous. Like character, the leader’s political self can find expression in a variety of ways. Some presidential candidates stress their activism (J. F. Kennedy), others their seriousness (Dukakis), and others make use of their geniality (Reagan). The political self can be viewed, therefore, as the way in which skills and character have been integrated into an approach to the task of political leadership.\n10. As Hargrove (1974, 76) notes, excellent political skills can be used for destructive purposes.\nNotes to Chapter Fourteen\n1. The questions put forward in this chapter are meant to supplement, not replace, other forms of information gathering, such as a candidate’s written record (speeches, writings, etc.).\n2. For the statistically minded, the issues concern the validity and reliability of data, which are affected by such things as sampling, indicator construction, using statistical "},"document":{"title":"The Psychological Assessment of Presidential Candidates","author":"Stanley A.
