Following up on the pioneering research of Gene Chapin, Martin Feldstein estimated in the 1970s that unemployment insurance payments serve to raise the aggregate unemployment rate by the better part of one full percentage point.17\nLess publicized is the extraordinary growth in workers’ compensation payments particularly in recent years. In 1989, over 13.8 million Americans from sixteen to sixty-four were classified as having an employment disability, some 8.6 percent of that population.18 As table 13.3 demonstrates, disability payments have exploded in recent years.
