(It was only by a comparatively small majority: if only thirty votes, out of five hundred or so, had changed sides, the outcome would have been different).22  In his discussion with his old friend Crito, Socrates appears to shift the identity of the object of his self-sacrifice. He also seems to shift the identity of the source of the injustice done to him.\nThe upshot is as follows: If it is men, not the laws,23  who visited injustice on him, then to seek to escape their judgment is to retaliate against them in the sense that he would treat them unjustly, as they had treated him. The whole avowedly novel and peculiar doctrine of nonretaliation is first enunciated in the Crito, with the implication that to escape would be to treat unjustly the jurors who had condemned him to death unjustly; to treat them as they had treated him. The retaliation is not in kind; rather, it repays an unjust effect with an unjust intention (vengeance). Retaliation is made to look worse than the initial act of injustice.\nBut it is not clear to me that the doctrine of nonretaliation as Socrates initially formulates it pertains to the mistaken and perhaps malicious jurors. Perhaps a more suitable referent awaits these unprecedented words:\nFor there is no difference, is there, between doing evil to a man and acting unjustly? … Then we ought not repay injustice with injustice or to do harm to any man, no matter what we may have suffered from him. … Are we to start in our inquiry from the premise that it is never right either to act unjustly, or to repay injustice with injustice, or to avenge ourselves on any man who harms us, by harming him in return. … I myself have believed in it for a long time, and I believe in it still.24 \nAs an individual who is also an uncommon citizen but one who is not necessarily—or necessarily not—setting himself up as a model for collectivities and their leadership, Socrates says that it is right to abstain from punishing the guilty. To punish them is to harm or injure them in some sense, and to harm or injure them is to treat them wrongly or unjustly. (The distinctions between these notions tend to disappear.) To give those who have wronged oneself what the world thinks they deserve is to render them "},"document":{"title":"Integrity and Conscience","author":"Ian Shapiro","publisher":"New York University Press","id":81,"isbn":"9780814780978"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":33345,"display_name":"Socrates -- view of citizenship"},"id":84321,"ring_next":21970,"ring_prev":21963}],"localid":"page_90","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch05.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_90\">","css_selector":"#page_90","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_90\"]"},"next_location_id":21968,"previous_location_id":21966}]
