Along with the era's other new, and not so new, symbols of the modern—cinema, dynamite, bombs, violent crime, cosmetics, lurid posters, vivid advertising—these immensely popular crime genres represented “newness” for a culture obsessed with modernity, and they employed the female criminal to embody and explain the shock of modern life.\n"},"document":{"title":"Framed: The New Woman Criminal in British Culture at the Fin de Siecle","author":"Elizabeth Carolyn Miller","publisher":"University of Michigan Press and University of Michigan Library","id":29,"isbn":"9780472024469"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":7585,"display_name":"decadence"},"id":24558,"ring_next":5990,"ring_prev":6175},{"basket":{"id":7640,"display_name":"dynamite"},"id":24828,"ring_next":5978,"ring_prev":6226},{"basket":{"id":7887,"display_name":"penny dreadfuls"},"id":25914,"ring_next":6118,"ring_prev":6118},{"basket":{"id":7934,"display_name":"sensationalism"},"id":26224,"ring_next":5994,"ring_prev":6214},{"basket":{"id":7935,"display_name":"sensation fiction"},"id":26239,"ring_next":5980,"ring_prev":6188},{"basket":{"id":7978,"display_name":"terrorism / terrorists"},"id":26509,"ring_next":5980,"ring_prev":6225}],"localid":"page_2","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/07_introduction.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_2\">","css_selector":"#page_2","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_2\"]"},"next_location_id":5977,"previous_location_id":5975}]
