And Chu Ch’ang-gyu’s erudite essay, “The (Re)construction of Nation and Gender in the Postcolonial Nation-State,” invokes a broad range of postcolonial theories to argue that the dilemmas and contradictions of postwar nation building—including the pressing need to bury the colonial past and to create “new men”—are directly reflected in Rice. Through a straightforward reading (which he calls a “case study”) of Rice’s narrative, Chu concludes that the film clearly lays bare the “elite, bourgeois nationalist norms” internalized by Shin and the audiences with whom the film was such a success.\n  5  See the collection of essays in Kim So-yŏn et al., An Age of Allures and Chaos, for their diverse and important engagements with the film cultures of the period. Nancy Abelmann and Kathleen McHugh’s edited volume, South Korean Golden Age Melodrama, remains the seminal collection of English-language scholarship.\n  6  The original novel, published serially in 1936 and as a monograph in 1946, quickly became an icon of colonial period literature. I treat its canonization in more detail below. I would like to note here though that its author, Sim Hun, identified almost exclusively with this narrative, was keenly interested in film and not only wrote a number of scenarios but also acted in a handful of films.\n  7  Administrative changes that took place sometime in the past decade positioned Muju in north Cholla province.\n  8  See Chŏng Chong-hwa, Korean Film History, for listings of box-office receipts as far back as the late 1930s.\n  9  The Grand Bells were inaugurated in 1961 under the auspices of the First Motion Picture Law and widely recognized as a state-controlled system of rewards for compliant filmmaking.\n10  “Evergreen Goes to Cannes,” Cine21 (March 2003).\n11  Some clarification is required here. As we saw in chapters 1 and 2, a fuller expression of mass culture in the colonial period was limited by the political and economic imbalances of public culture under Japanese authority. Cinema in South Korea arose in the 1960s as the most significant modern mass cultural formation, screening emergent subjects in the midst of astounding change and complexity. Concepts of national time and space and modern social and economic relations had already been established by the end of colonial rule. Cities had grown as sites of colonial extraction but had also become spheres of increased cultural exchange and consumption. And mass communications technologies had facilitated the broad circulation of not only imperial discourse but also the language, image, and idea of modern Korea. Modern culture, however, had remained dominantly the product of the metropole and of the colonial elite, and while this hegemony did not preclude the advent of national consciousness, it did inhibit the development of mass culture. The disassembly of formal colonial rule that began in 1945, almost wholly subsumed within the global conflict between neoliberal capitalism and authoritarian communism, engendered, especially in the South, little qualitative institutional or social change.
