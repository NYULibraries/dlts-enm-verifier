Saurabh is concerned about intergenerational conflict and a loss of Indian identity. He worries because agents have become so Westernized that they have begun to disrespect their parents.\n\nThey spend whatever they want. They go out. You can say that the economy is booming, but [pause] there is no control, and in the sense, typically, you have guys who are twenty-one, twenty-two, staying away from home and earning fifteen grand, which is a lot of money, you know? And you have no control. The parents are not here, and you lose control. So I guess that is what is happening more than the fact that we are losing our identity because of speaking with [U.S.] customers. (Saurabh, I2U, personal interview, 2004)\n\nAlthough Saurabh is himself an agent, he depicts the agent in his story as other, referring to agents as “they” and as gendered as male. The agent/other is marked through an accelerated relationship to space and time that is bound up in his newfound economic mobility. He moves through space with “no control” (“they go out,” “staying away from home”), generating space-time distance from the previous generation (“the parents are not here”). An anxious space-time rupture animates Saurabh’s account as the acceleration of class mobility is ultimately a fear over “losing our identity.” For Saurabh, a collective Indian identity is at risk, not only because agents are immersed in what we’ve called a virtual borderlands as workers, but also because agents are excessive consumers. This collective identity, framed through his repeated reference to agents’ lack of control, is laid in precarious balance between a familiar Indian past and an unknown future.\nSaurabh continues to make the point that agents have been thoroughly cultivated as consumers when asked what agents do with their money:\n\nShopping, buying, clubbing, clubbing, clubbing. And that’s fine, I guess. They are spending money and having fun. But a lot of guys do not have focus on what they are doing. So they don’t—they see it as easy money, but I don’t know how many of them are actually taking it as a very serious career, or even thinking in the long term, of what they will do. (Saurabh, I2U, personal interview, 2004).\n\nIn a formulation that extends Freeman’s argument, Saurabh goes so far as to suggest agents forego their identities as workers (they earn “easy"},"document":{"title":"Answer the Call","author":"Aimee Carrillo Rowe, Sheena Malhotra, and Kimberlee Pérez","publisher":"The Regents of the University of Minnesota","id":109,"isbn":"9781452940397"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_160","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/Text/chapter-004.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<span id=\"page_160\"/>","css_selector":"#page_160","xpath":"span[id=\"page_160\"]"},"next_location_id":30154,"previous_location_id":30152}]
