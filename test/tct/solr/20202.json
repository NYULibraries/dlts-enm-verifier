It is the problem of prophetic ethos that must next be attended to, leaving Phillips with the self-assessment of a melodramatic reformer hero created by one of Phillips’s contemporaries, Nathaniel Hawthorne. Quitting his “cosey pair of bachelor-rooms—with a good fire burning in the grate, and a closet right at hand, where there was still a bottle or two in the champagne-basket and a residuum of claret in a box,” Miles Coverdale left the pollution of the city to journey in a snowstorm to Blithedale where he and his compatriots were to form a community based on virtue and self-reliance that would set an example for the world. On this occasion, Hawthorne allows his protagonist to observe,\nThe greatest obstacle to being heroic, is the doubt whether one may not be going to prove one’s self a fool; the truest heroism is, to resist the doubt—and the profoundest wisdom, to know when it ought to be resisted, and when to be obeyed. Yet, after all, let us acknowledge it wiser, if not more sagacious, to follow out one’s day-dream to its natural consummation, although, if the vision have been worth the having, it is certain never to be consummated otherwise than by a failure. And what of that! Its airiest fragments, impalpable as they may be will possess a value that lurks not in the most ponderous realities of any practicable scheme. They are not the rubbish of the mind. Whatever else I may repent of, therefore, let it be reckoned neither among my sins nor follies, that I once had faith and force enough to form generous hopes of the world’s destiny—yes!—and to do what in me lay for their accomplishment.121\n\n\n"},"document":{"title":"The Prophetic Tradition and Radical Rhetoric in America","author":"James Darsey","publisher":"New York University Press","id":75,"isbn":"9780814718766"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":30608,"display_name":"Hawthorne, Nathaniel, The Blithedale Romance"},"id":77406,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":30516,"display_name":"ethos -- and melodrama"},"id":77698,"ring_next":20201,"ring_prev":20201}],"localid":"page_84","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch04.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_84\">","css_selector":"#page_84","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_84\"]"},"next_location_id":20203,"previous_location_id":20201}]
