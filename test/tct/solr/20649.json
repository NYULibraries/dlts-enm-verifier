Researchers are consistent in their findings that gender constancy “is remarkably independent of other components of gender-related behaviors.... Gender constancy is unrelated to sex-typed toy choice, to the imitation of same gender models, to the correct attributions of stereo-types to male and female figures, to measures of gender schematic processing, to attitudes toward boys and girls, and to gender discrimination in reward allocation.”52 In short, the consensus is that males and females will not have difficulties identifying their gender, nor will their sexual orientation be affected by changes in the contours of gender roles and ideals.\nThe Specter of a Unisex Universe\nThe suggestion that we make it easier to cross gender lines into nontraditional domestic and occupational roles raises fears of an androgynous world: qualms about unisex bathrooms and unidimensional humans. This provokes a couple of questions. Is dismantling of gender lines necessarily a call for an androgynous society? And why do people fear androgyny?\nTo answer the latter question first, fear of androgyny may be, in large part, an investment in traditional roles. Some qualms about androgyny certainly shade into concerns about sexual preferences. The more benign explanation is that people recognize diversity as a good—even if much of that diversity is culturally, rather than naturally, defined. People like living in a world with feminine and masculine cultures; they distrust melting pot concepts; and they worry about watering down distinctiveness, whether racial, ethnic, or gender.\nThe plea for “diversity,” though, is somewhat curious in this context, since what is usually sought are the traditional gender differences: we want people to be different on the axis of masculinity and femininity. I presented these ideas on a radio call-in show. One of the callers was the father of a six-year-old girl, who liked his daughter’s feminine qualities: her sweetness, cuddliness, and nurturing behavior. They sounded like terrific qualities for any six-year-old, male or female.\nThe alternative is to retain masculine and feminine qualities, but not to attach either to a particular sex. We have tacitly accepted for so many generations that gender differences are the ones that matter. Why not emphasize other forms of diversity between people: on the scales of creativity, endurance, "},"document":{"title":"The Gender Line","author":"Nancy Levit","publisher":"New York University Press","id":76,"isbn":"9780814751213"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":31297,"display_name":"Gender -- crossing gender lines"},"id":78612,"ring_next":20446,"ring_prev":20637},{"basket":{"id":31173,"display_name":"Unisex approaches"},"id":79112,"ring_next":20537,"ring_prev":20537}],"localid":"page_241","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch08.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_241\">","css_selector":"#page_241","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_241\"]"},"next_location_id":20650,"previous_location_id":20648}]
