Martin's day also highlights interactivity from a very different perspective: he was all about creating interactive content for his work. But he shows the lack of established patterns and processes for doing so: he had an ad-hoc meeting with his favorite videographer and didn't tell his editor (or the business desk Web editors) what he was thinking. The way he integrated interactivity into his workflow is distinct from most journalists at The Times.\nBilton's day, on the other hand, shows how a nontraditional journalist (a blogger) handled a pretty out-of-the ordinary story: the announcement of the first iPad. This was big news to the newsroom—expected in the sense that reporters knew Steve Jobs had planned a big unveiling, but unexpected because they had no idea what the product would be and what it could do. Bilton's day chronicles the pressures of immediacy and trying to report using nontraditional platforms: checking competing blogs and Twitter, and running the nytimes.com “live blog” and other experiments. His attempts to create graphics and content for the event showcase the varying levels of importance and facility that journalists felt toward interactivity. And his work on social media platforms underscores an important theme we will see later in the book, that when journalists do participate online, they use the Web for reporting and to broadcast their views or to talk to other established people. With rare exceptions, participation remains a one-to-many experience, with few voices from the audience heard.\nThroughout the book, we'll see many different types of journalists in action, from Web producers to interactive news journalists, but here, I've focused on journalists who highlight the relationship between “tradition and change”3 in the newsroom. In the case of Bowley, we see an old-school reporter working under new pressure—though he also had the liberty to work on off-deadline stories; in the case of Martin, we see a traditional reporter working on off-deadline stories, but with a new perspective; and in the case of Bilton, we see a different type of journalist covering a story demanding a variety of new tools and platforms. From a close look at a day in the life of Bowley, Martin, and Bilton, a picture emerges of how journalists were adapting (or not) to the values of immediacy, interactivity, and participation—and just how these values were, indeed, contested ones.\n"},"document":{"title":"Making News at The New York Times","author":"Usher, Nikki","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":30,"isbn":"9780472120499"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":8081,"display_name":"Bilton, Nick -- day in the life of"},"id":26986,"ring_next":6341,"ring_prev":6318},{"basket":{"id":8105,"display_name":"Bowley, Graham -- day in the life of"},"id":27050,"ring_next":6321,"ring_prev":6319},{"basket":{"id":8117,"display_name":"business desk"},"id":27097,"ring_next":6339,"ring_prev":6319},{"basket":{"id":8252,"display_name":"immediacy -- pressures"},"id":27616,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":8281,"display_name":"interactivity -- workflow"},"id":27695,"ring_next":6331,"ring_prev":6331},{"basket":{"id":8052,"display_name":"iPad"},"id":27711,"ring_next":6343,"ring_prev":6319},{"basket":{"id":8294,"display_name":"Jobs, Steve"},"id":27749,"ring_next":6344,"ring_prev":6347},{"basket":{"id":8314,"display_name":"live blogs"},"id":27816,"ring_next":6344,"ring_prev":6312},{"basket":{"id":8326,"display_name":"Martin, Andrew: day in the life of"},"id":27849,"ring_next":6332,"ring_prev":6319},{"basket":{"id":8398,"display_name":"nytimes.com -- liveblog"},"id":28057,"ring_next":6343,"ring_prev":6382},{"basket":{"id":8411,"display_name":"participation"},"id":28160,"ring_next":6331,"ring_prev":6319},{"basket":{"id":369,"display_name":"Twitter"},"id":28534,"ring_next":6343,"ring_prev":6297},{"basket":{"id":8541,"display_name":"values"},"id":28592,"ring_next":6333,"ring_prev":6318},{"basket":{"id":8567,"display_name":"Web -- producers"},"id":28742,"ring_next":6331,"ring_prev":6315}],"localid":"page_52","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter02.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_52\">","css_selector":"#page_52","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_52\"]"},"next_location_id":6321,"previous_location_id":6319}]
