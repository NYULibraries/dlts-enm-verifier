If we care to understand the current and potential capacities of technology for cognition, learning, literacy, and education, than we must look to contexts outside our current formal education system rather than those within.36\n \nWe intended from the start that Tecumseh Lies Here would engage and critique certain “misuses” of history. Our game therefore includes fake and forged historical documents, conspiracy theories, and counterfactuals. We considered even more fantastical elements, such as time travel and alternate history. Professional historians are extremely wary of such pseudohistorical tropes, yet they are familiar and beloved by many amateur history makers and enthusiasts. They are basic elements of much historical play.\nWe were inspired by educational projects like The Lost Museum and the Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History (see chapter 1), which manage to be playful yet remain eminently respectable in their historical practice. Still, we believed there was room for something edgier, less sober, and more playful than these examples. We hoped to produce something that might capture the imagination of gamers and playful history subcultures. We wanted a game that did not look or feel like it was designed for a classroom. We wanted, frankly, to play with toys that historians are not supposed to play with. James Paul Gee has asserted that video games, and perhaps all games, require an element of social transgression.37 All games have rules, but play is not truly play until some rules are broken. This did not mean that we abdicated our responsibility to think and talk about the ethical and professional questions posed by pseudohistorical play. Instead, it meant that we talked about these questions all the time.\nWe took some guidance from our subjects and desired audience in both gaming and vernacular history communities. Many hobby subcultures, especially those that are in any way transgressive, develop their own codes of ethical practice and self-regulation.38 ARG players debate codes and practices about privacy, trespassing, interacting with nonparticipants, and so on. Historical reenactors care devoutly about authenticity and respect for the past. And history gamers place a high priority on historical realism even or especially when their scenarios diverge wildly from actual history. These codes are "},"document":{"title":"Pastplay: Teaching and Learning History with Technology","author":"Kee, Kevin","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":1,"isbn":"9780472120482"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":7,"display_name":"amateur historians"},"id":16,"ring_next":287,"ring_prev":109},{"basket":{"id":61,"display_name":"counterfactuals"},"id":228,"ring_next":225,"ring_prev":291},{"basket":{"id":158,"display_name":"playfulness, in learning history -- in history research"},"id":579,"ring_next":199,"ring_prev":98},{"basket":{"id":208,"display_name":"video games -- in history education"},"id":747,"ring_next":135,"ring_prev":106}],"localid":"page_104","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter04.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_104\">","css_selector":"#page_104","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_104\"]"},"next_location_id":113,"previous_location_id":111}]
