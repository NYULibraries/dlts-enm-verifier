Digital hypertext might contribute to a disequilibrium between the presumably masculine and feminine narrative tendencies by privileging or enabling the reader’s engagement with textuality to such an extent that it might eclipse or elude the masculine writing subject—embodied in the figure of the author—and his instrumental mastery through narrative altogether. If literary print narrative overlooks the process of meaning-production in favor of its end—narrative meaning—digital hypertext allows one to become so immersed in the instruments and scene of meaning production that one forgets the point of narrative altogether. In “Click” Val provides a cautionary example of this latter possibility, spending much of the story exploring a website depicting the webmaster/narrator’s writing desk, then proceeding to examine the view out his window. Due to her tendency to elaborate, enhance, and, in this way, to digress, she is utterly incapable of telling a story, according to Mark. Val here represents the inhuman, process-based iterability unleashed by the digital scene of writing. She is, not coincidentally, aligned with the very material and technological occasions of writing that the story wants to mitigate, if not transcend.\nHow Media Make a Difference\n“Click” evokes precisely the dis-ease it attempts to vanquish by confining digital hypertext to the abstract realm of narrative complexity.
