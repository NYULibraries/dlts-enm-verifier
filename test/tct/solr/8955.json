Damayanti returns her husband’s love by accompanying him in exile into the wilderness.\nBut Damayanti had already faced an equally great danger. Just as Etain’s beauty had made her the object of Midir’s desire, so has Damayanti’s loveliness brought her to the attention of Indra. In the meantime Nala has also heard of her renowned beauty (significantly, by an intermediary in the form of a swan), and Damayanti dares to choose him over a divine spouse. The gods do not retaliate at once; like the Gandharvas who want Urvaśī back, they bide their time. Nala and Damayanti live happily for many years and have two children, until Nala plays the fateful game with his brother, who in the human world reenacts the passion and threat of the gods. And as was true in the story of Purūravas and Urvaśī, Nala’s error (in this case, gambling serves the function of the broken taboo motif) supplies the irate gods with their opportunity to move against the mortal pair. The ensuing catastrophe can thus be located in the dynamics of human relations and actions rather than any simplistically conceived of intervention of supernatural agencies.\nTheir status as mortal women about whom hover the images of the fairy wife provides the stories of Etain and Damayanti with an ambiguity that is underscored by juxtaposing the stories of the two women. Midir had been Etain’s first husband, and thus her “complicated history of previous existences”13 roots her in the otherworld. Like the seal maiden whose primary allegiance is to the bull seal who claims her, or the archetypal swan maiden described by Lessa, Etain lives in this world as a temporary guest and never seems quite to belong in it. In contrast, Damayanti’s allegiance to Nala—symbolically, to the human world—seems unambivalent, and only by appearing as mortals can the gods hope to trick and thus conquer her.
