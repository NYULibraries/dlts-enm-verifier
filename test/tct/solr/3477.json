Atrus is left with a linking book to Riven, and it is on Riven that he meets Katran (Catherine), Gehn's student whom he plans to have as his bride. But Catherine loves Atrus instead, and writes Myst Island for them as a refuge. By the end of the story, everything has been set up for Myst to pick up where the book ended.\nThe second novel, Myst: The Book of Ti'ana, is also well written, and has a good amount of invention in the creation of its world. The book is set even farther back in time, and tells the story of the fall of the D'ni empire, the same story that Gehn tells Atrus on pages 177â€“82 of Myst: The Book of Atrus. The book goes into even greater detail about how the D'ni lived, mined, and built, and what their civilization was like, as well as its demise. Finally, the book's epilogue has Anna and Gehn moving to the cleft where Myst: The Book of Atrus begins. The events of the book form the backdrop and history for the events of Myst and Riven and the D'ni culture, their underground city, and Art of Writing, and the book can also stand on its own apart from both the game and the first Myst novel. The novel also features a colored map inside its front cover, which shows the tunnels from the cleft to the underground city, both in a top view and a side-view elevation.\nThe third novel, Myst: The Book of D'ni, begins some time after the other two novels. The underground kingdom of the D'ni has lain in ruin for forty years. Atrus and others link into the prison room in K'veer and drill their way out, and then proceed to explore the ruins of the city. Atrus plans to find as many books as possible and gather the survivors living in the various Ages, with the hope of having them return to help rebuild D'ni. We learn a bit more about the D'ni civilization, along with the newer characters, and there are a few interesting new details, like the environmental verification suits worn by members of the Maintainer's Guild when they go in to check an Age. But the book falls short of the first two Myst books, partly because the newer characters, particularly the always-enthusiastic students Marrim, Irras, and Carrad, lack the headstrong independent spirit found in Atrus, Catherine, Anna, Gehn, and Veovis (a pivotal character introduced in Myst: The Book of Ti'ana). Myst: The Book of D'ni lacks the conflict between the characters that made the other two novels interesting and gave them their emotional range and urgency. Here the characters explore the ruins and Ages together, harmoniously and without even a sense of time pressure to hurry them onward, resulting in a story that is a bit too relaxed compared to the other two.\n"},"document":{"title":"Myst and Riven: The World of the D'ni","author":"Wolf, Mark J.
