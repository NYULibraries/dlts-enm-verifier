To reify nature and attribute intelligence to it would certainly be preposterous, but to speak instead of God as architect would nevertheless be presumptuous (ibid., p. 230). 6 Furthermore, consistent with the results of his Critique of Pure Reason, Kant declares that even the claim regarding purposes in nature cannot be seen as a “constitutive concept of understanding or reason, but it can serve as a regulative concept for the reflective judgment …”(ibid., p. 222).7 Thus Kant provides the argumentation for restoring the proof from design and purpose, but, given his denial of the possibility of metaphysical knowledge, he himself refuses to grant his teleological judgment anything more than the status of a regulative idea. It is at this point in the philosophical dialogue that Krochmal steps in.\nKrochmal begins by first restating the argument in its traditional form, as we saw it above. That is, in every effect in nature there is an efficient cause, and in addition there appears to be a final cause, or a purpose toward which this effect is directed. Thus, the existence of plants would be caused, not merely by whatever biological functions produce them, but also by the need of a willing designer to provide sustenance for his “higher” creatures. The traditional view, then, is that all things exist for a cause; many, although not all, of this argument’s adherents would claim that human beings are, in fact, the ultimate telos for which all other things exist.
