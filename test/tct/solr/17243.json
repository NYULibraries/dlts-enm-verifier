Permission is granted by local option for the Sunday operation after 1 p.m. of amusement parks and beach resorts, including participation in bowling and games of amusement for which prizes are awarded.55\n\nAnd the list goes on (and on). Despite this seemingly endless litany of exemptions, the Court upheld the state’s astounding refusal to grant an exemption to Orthodox Jews (would granting an exemption have undermined the purpose of the law?). In fact, many states continued to enforce Sunday laws until economic considerations forced a change: as more and more stores opened along suburban highways or in shopping malls instead of in downtown districts, Sunday became increasingly commercialized. These new stores sought to attract shoppers on the weekends, including Sundays, because urban workers could not walk (or run) conveniently into suburban stores while on workday lunch breaks or immediately after work.56\nThe next major decision, Engel v. Vitale, probably did more than any other to reinforce the dominant story of the separation of church and state. In 1951, the Board of Regents of the state of New York had recommended that local school boards have children recite a prayer each day in school in order to promote religious commitment and moral and spiritual values. The Regents recommended the use of a supposedly “nondenominational” prayer: “Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country.”57 In 1958, when the school board in the town of New Hyde Park, Long Island, adopted this prayer for use in the classrooms, several parents decided to challenge its constitutionality. Early reactions to this litigation were foreboding, as the plaintiffs received numerous hate letters. One letter, for example, stated: “This looks like Jews trying to grab America as Jews grab everything they want in any nation. America is a Christian nation.” Another letter declared: “If you don’t like our God, then go behind the Iron Curtain where you belong, Kike, Hebe, Filth.”58 When the Supreme Court decided the case in 1962, Engel v. Vitale held that the daily recitation of the Regents’ prayer in the public schools violated the establishment clause. The Court drew upon Protestant history to interpret the establishment clause: the Puritans, the Court recalled, had fled England for America in the seventeenth century to avoid following the governmentally imposed Book of Common Prayer for the Church of England. Daily recitation of the Regents’ prayer, according to the Court, resounded too closely with the official imposition of a Prayer Book. The Court reasoned further that the first amendment prohibited any law that established an “official religion,” even if the law did not coerce religious practices.
