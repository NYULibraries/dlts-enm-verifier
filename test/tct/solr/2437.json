Students, writing of necessity as outsiders, see themselves as pressured to consult the experts, to patch together others' ideas and words (see Howard) in the hope of coming closer to understanding the subject than they would if they depended on their own ideas. Yet as outsiders suppressing their own judgments, student writers serving as ventriloquists of published scholars are not positioned to own the primary material or to trust their opinions of it. With so little of themselves in their writing, they have little incentive to care very much about their work.\nInsider Writing\nIn contrast, when students write from inside the problem, issue, or literary or historical work at hand, they operate as engaged participants rather than as alien outsiders whose understanding comes through what others—sometimes centuries of others—have had to say on the subject. As I explain below, through the examples of my own literature course and those in other disciplines, teachers in all fields can construct assignments that compel their students to understand the perspectives, values, beliefs, norms, and customs as insiders. By creating dialogues, dramatizations, primary documents, or position papers in the process, students are directed to produce meaning, rather than to reproduce received opinion.\nWith such assignments, student authors perforce have to accept and assume some authority for knowing and understanding the problem or issue at hand. Admittedly, this authority is limited by the students' actual experience with or understanding of the situation they're writing about, as it would be in most undergraduate papers. Yet these assignments have considerable integrity, and consequently, so do the students. Teachers whose courses are described below (see also Adler-Kassner, Crooks, and Watters; Downing, Hurlbert, and Mathieu; Flower; Grobman) claim that because as a rule the students are heavily invested in the lively dialogues or events in which they're participating, they work harder, learn more (they generally have to buttress their insider understanding with outside sources), and write far more convincingly than with the usual routine academic exercises. Because these writing assignments are highly specific to both the courses and to the individual student's participation in them, they're more varied, more interesting, and nearly impossible to plagiarize. As the context changes every semester, so do the assignments; students have to construct their specifically nuanced topic from the ground up, every time.\n"},"document":{"title":"Originality, Imitation, and Plagiarism","author":"Eisner, Caroline; Vicinus, Martha","publisher":"University of Michigan Press and University of Michigan Library","id":12,"isbn":"9780472024445"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2770,"display_name":"ideas -- ownership of"},"id":9190,"ring_next":2229,"ring_prev":2369},{"basket":{"id":3124,"display_name":"words"},"id":10117,"ring_next":2453,"ring_prev":2427}],"localid":"page_210","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/26_chap18.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_210\">","css_selector":"#page_210","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_210\"]"},"next_location_id":2438,"previous_location_id":2436}]
