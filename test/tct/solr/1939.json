First, with the global network made possible by the Internet, countries around the world are densely connected. Access points to this global network, however, still remain local. They are bounded by the political and social interests of territorial governments. Who controls the Internet is therefore of significant importance to international communication “to determine what is to be delivered and how” (Chang, 2010, p. 13). Second, although globalization implies a weakened nation-state, the new form of state in today’s information age is the network state (Carnoy & Castells, 2001, p. 14), in which each node—the nation-state—is linked to other nodes “that are equally necessary for the performance of the state’s functions.” Given this networked structure at the global level where the flows move in many directions, how does cultural imperialism take place?\nThis study contends that the theory has lagged far behind the new reality. In international communication research, the state of theory is either underdeveloped in the first place or misguided by the traditional ways of thinking and conceiving the world, or both. Simply put, there is a lack of alternative perspectives. Groupthink still permeates in the intellectual enterprise in the field of international communication. For one thing, theorists of cultural imperialism have failed to take note of the technological innovations and the shift of content production and distribution from corporate interests to user-generated concerns (e.g., Web 2.0) that have largely reshaped the form and content of global media.\nTechnologically, the new global media environment defies traditional conceptions, requiring theoretical rethinking of what is to be seen and how to see it. Why would a theory formulated at a time when countries were not as connected as they are today continue to be relevant to the network society created by the ubiquitous Internet? When the object of observation has changed, would the focus of conceptual lens capture the same image as it appeared before? Implied in these questions are layers of conceptual focus and their different theoretical formulation. This has implications for international communication research. As Alford and Friedland (1985) argued, “theories themselves must be analyzed at different levels, which cannot be reduced to each other” (p. 392). Epistemologically, Thomas Kuhn (1970) reasoned convincingly that no existing theory should be tested in isolation by itself. Goffman’s (1974) notion of “keying” in frame analysis is relevant. A theory provides a frame that is keyed to see the reality in some way.\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2126,"display_name":"Avatar -- Cultural reception"},"id":6390,"ring_next":2038,"ring_prev":2038},{"basket":{"id":1114,"display_name":"Imperialism -- cultural"},"id":6773,"ring_next":1940,"ring_prev":1938},{"basket":{"id":277,"display_name":"globalization"},"id":7041,"ring_next":1940,"ring_prev":1922},{"basket":{"id":2237,"display_name":"Globalization -- Internet"},"id":7078,"ring_next":2079,"ring_prev":2182},{"basket":{"id":2238,"display_name":"Goffman, Erving"},"id":7088,"ring_next":1940,"ring_prev":1930},{"basket":{"id":250,"display_name":"internet"},"id":7346,"ring_next":1964,"ring_prev":1938},{"basket":{"id":2293,"display_name":"Kuhn, Thomas"},"id":7443,"ring_next":1944,"ring_prev":1929},{"basket":{"id":2337,"display_name":"Nation-state"},"id":7758,"ring_next":1996,"ring_prev":1937},{"basket":{"id":2342,"display_name":"Network -- Global/transnational network"},"id":7807,"ring_next":1944,"ring_prev":1906},{"basket":{"id":2147,"display_name":"Network society theory"},"id":7811,"ring_next":1944,"ring_prev":1898},{"basket":{"id":2354,"display_name":"Paradigm -- Paradigm testing"},"id":7886,"ring_next":1944,"ring_prev":2171},{"basket":{"id":2370,"display_name":"Political economy -- Vs. audience decoding, audience reception"},"id":7938,"ring_next":2038,"ring_prev":1910}],"localid":"page_52","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter03.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_52\">","css_selector":"#page_52","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_52\"]"},"next_location_id":1940,"previous_location_id":1938}]
