Economic pressures, beginning with the later stages of the baby boomers’ maturation, prompted marriage at older ages. New sexual habits, particularly the normalcy of premarital sex, removed certain mysteries from love. For some teenagers who preferred to delay their sexual initiation, the new sexual habits also reinforced a certain reserve that could replace standardized rules like “good girls say no.” These new factors added to the ongoing culture of emotional reticence, allowing this culture in essence to implement the limitations on mutual devotion that were generated by economic changes. Love, already in process of redefinition by the 1930s, came to take on different meanings for young people, becoming either more purely sexual or more cautious or both, as economic and sexual realities prompted fuller acceptance of post-Victorian standards in generating real emotional life.\nFriendship as well as love reflected the effects of new adult constraints and of new vocabulary. Male friendship changed decisively. The loving attachments that young middle-class Victorian men had openly sought and described disappeared. Some may have survived through the collegiate years, yielding only in early adulthood to less intense male contacts, but even before full adulthood, growing fear of homosexuality significantly reduced men’s willingness to talk or write about their emotions for each other or to combine emotion with open physical contact. As homosexuality gained new definition and more open disapproval, the male dilemma became in some senses a special case, but it also fit the larger pattern of downgrading intense emotional bonds. While male friendship was partially replaced by new social contacts with women, a certain guardedness often carried over into those contacts.27\nChildren still loved their mothers, but here too signs of altered emotional experience began to surface by the 1930s. A study of mother-daughter relationships notes a more relaxed, even flippant tone in daughters’ letters after the 1920s.28 A young woman thus wrote from camp: “It was nice to hear from you, to put it mildly. I’d like to write often very much … but alas and alack, when I have two minutes to sit down and write, I must write reports.” This letter actually resulted from the promptings of the young woman’s father. Women, apparently less intensely or at least more ambivalently attached to their mothers, became not only more nonchalant about staying in contact but also more likely to express open annoyance at interference.
