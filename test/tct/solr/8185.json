A few days later, Mondale attacked him as an “opportunist and divider” (New York Times, 18 March 1984, 24). During the campaign itself, Mondale criticized President Reagan’s lack of involvement in the office, not only accusing him of not applying himself but also questioning his capacity to understand and act on complicated issues (New York Times, 10 February 1984, 18).\nAs concern with the issue of character has intensified, the questions asked of candidates have broadened in scope. Areas of personal and family privacy have correspondingly receded. During the 1988 campaign, the early front-runner for the Democratic Party’s nomination, Gary Hart, was forced to drop out of the race when it was revealed that although married, he had spent the night with another woman. In the wake of that revelation and the candidate’s denial of wrongdoing, reporters were soon asking him directly whether he had ever committed adultery. At the time the question prompted fierce debate among journalists and political leaders, but four years later, in 1992, it was asked again of Bill Clinton, this time during a nationally televised news show with his wife at his side. The boundaries separating private from public are becoming increasingly permeable for political leaders.\nCentral to these character questions is the assumption that such information tells us something significant about candidates and their possible performance as president. However, it is by no means clear that the media reporting of character is necessarily revealing of what such reports presume to show. Nor is it always clear that the character signs uncovered are necessarily related to the capacity to govern wisely or well in the way it is assumed.\nConsider this in regard to the public display of emotion by political leaders. In the 1972 presidential campaign, Senator Edmund Muskie responded to a scurrilous editorial attack on his wife, Jane, in a speech in front of the New Hampshire newspaper that had published it. While delivering the speech, his voice choked and he appeared to be in tears. Publicly showing such relatively deep emotions provoked considerable comment and concern and was seen by some as a sign of potential weakness in the face of tough circumstances. After all, the reasoning went, if a candidate was moved to tears by a newspaper editorial, what would he do when the going really got tough?\n"},"document":{"title":"The Psychological Assessment of Presidential Candidates","author":"Stanley A.
