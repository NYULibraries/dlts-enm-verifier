In such an atmosphere, purity itself could not escape contamination.”17\nThere are, to be sure, rational reasons for protesting such conditions, but there is also an obsessional-compulsive undercurrent to these protests. For the reformers were objecting to confusion, and confusion may lie at the heart of what we imagine as dirt. As Mary Douglas explains: “For us dirt is a kind of compendium category for all events which blur, smudge, contradict, or otherwise confuse accepted classifications.”18 In a similar vein, psychoanalyst Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel emphasizes that forbidden mixtures, mixtures that confound dissimilar things, are the essence of anality. The prototype of such chaotic mixtures is excrement, a homogeneous blend of substances that were originally distinct. In contrast to the Biblical world of division and separation stands this “universe of perversion.”19\nIf one sign of the obsessional theme in prison reform is a revulsion from the indiscriminate mingling of the old-style prisons, another is the preoccupation with order and separation in the new prisons.
