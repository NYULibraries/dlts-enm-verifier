In his rage and grief, the husband threatens to smother the baby but is stopped by his father, who had known of his son’s sterility all along. The film’s last image is a tableau of the family’s peculiar patriarchy: the lineage-obsessed grandfather, the sterile son, the mute father, and the cherished scion.\nThe third and last extant installment,69 “Hidden Desires of the Royal Palace” (“Kŭmjung pisaek”) is set among the society of palace ladies who serve the unchecked cravings of a Yŏnsan-like monarch. Middle-aged Madame Yi, whose sole task is to observe and report on the activities of the nocturnal royal chamber, is doomed to a maddening suppression of sexual arousal. When she is pushed beyond endurance and dashes beyond the palace walls, she is ravished in the woods by a faceless stranger and becomes pregnant. Despite repeated attempts to abort the pregnancy, her predicament is discovered by the senior palace ladies, who are nevertheless convinced to protect Yi and help her bring her child into the world by hiding her in an abandoned storeroom. On one of their trips to the storeroom, they spy the baby’s father and, mistakenly fearing for their reputation (being discovered outside the palace walls is a sin punishable by death), join together and kill him. The story ends well, however, for the ladies pack Yi and her baby into a coffin (that is, the only vehicle through which a woman can leave the court) and send the single mother out free into the world.\nCruel Stories is unique within Shin’s oeuvre and in the canon of Korean film in a number of ways. In addition to its omnibus structure (which was, further, intended to be color-coordinated), it is, generically, neither a typical period piece nor a melodrama; rather, it contains elements of both and infuses the macabre sensibility of the horror film. And while, as mentioned above, it is a much more modest production than the period pieces of the early 1960s, it is reminiscent of the way The Wanderer and Thousand Years Fox invested a higher level of sophistication and complexity into a seemingly minor and luridly sensationalist film. The cast, in fact, is made up of nearly all the leading female faces of the 1960s (Ch’oe Ŭn-hŭi, Kim Chi-mi, Chu Chŭng-nyŏ, To Kŭm-bong, Hwang Chŏng-sun, etc.), a high-value list that was nonetheless compromised by the fact that nearly all of them were in the twilight of their careers (which imparts the subtle sense that the film as a whole is somehow a last gasp at greatness). Cruel Stories, nevertheless, is lively and novel; the short, elliptical episodes are fast and engrossing and give the archaic (and to an extent absurd) stories a dimension of playful enjoyment. The film, to the studio’s pleasant surprise, was a minor hit, successful on its first release and especially popular in its second run.
