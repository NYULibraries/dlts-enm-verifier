Finally, we are compelled to contend with the possibility that the preference for the period piece over youth film was Shin’s own, an authorial “signature.”\nThe stakes and implications of that signature will be elaborated below. At this juncture, however, it may be useful to pause and consider how genre filmmaking—not only the period film but the action and horror films as well—was inflected by the specialization of Shin Films as a regional studio and Shin’s directorial tendencies. While it was something of an anomaly in terms of its investment structure and its level of preparation, Sŏng Ch’unhyang is emblematic of the overall tenor of Shin’s productions. Most, but clearly not all, of the films are made to a standard of professionalism that, for regular filmgoers, would have been readily apparent. Not only did Shin utilize the latest technological innovations—the color cinemascope and zoom lenses, sync sound recording, and so on—but he invested significantly in keeping his studio up with the latest trends, subscribing regularly to American as well as the ostensibly banned Japanese film magazines, and inviting Japanese filmmakers and technicians to visit with his crew. It was thus not only screen composition that marked off Shin’s “golden age” films, but the whole surface of technical polish detailed in chapter 2 (smooth edits, subtle lighting, etc.) applied to a larger scale of filmmaking. Furthermore, Shin’s films were continually populated by the era’s top stars, an ensemble cast led by Ch’oe Ŭn-hŭi, Sin Yŏng-gyun, and Hŏ Chang-gang, who were easily identified with the roles they were assigned.\nAnother critical inflection is that the films Shin produced in each of the three minor genres were latecomers to the screen, following well behind the first flush of novelty and therefore positioned to refine or reconfigure the codes in various ways. As Jinsoo An has pointed out, the cycle of Machurian action films—“westerns” set in the vast Kando and Manchurian plains in the colonial period—began in 1962 with Im Kwon-t’aek’s Farewell Tumen River (Tuman kang’a chal ittkkŏra) and reached a peak in 1964 and 1965 with the release of a new picture nearly every month.63 The trend had eventually played out by 1967, so that by 1968, when Shin’s The Wanderer was released, it must have seemed incongruous or even nostalgic. And indeed its portrayal of a weary and embittered fighter in place of the committed and patriotic soldier of the classic films signaled a major shift in sensibility. Yet, it was The Wanderer’s gritty but minimal look, as well as its relaxed pace, more knowingly resonant with both the Japanese samurai and Italian "},"document":{"title":"Split Screen Korea","author":"Steven Chung","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","id":110,"isbn":"9781452941516"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":44789,"display_name":"An, Jinsoo"},"id":111775,"ring_next":30349,"ring_prev":30343},{"basket":{"id":44819,"display_name":"celebrities -- in Shin's films"},"id":111902,"ring_next":30310,"ring_prev":30338},{"basket":{"id":44835,"display_name":"Ch'oe Ŭn-hŭi (wife of Shin) -- in Shin's films"},"id":111946,"ring_next":30350,"ring_prev":30341},{"basket":{"id":44999,"display_name":"Hŏ Chang-gang (actor)"},"id":112560,"ring_next":30373,"ring_prev":30342},{"basket":{"id":45027,"display_name":"Im Kwon-taek -- Farewell to the Tumen River"},"id":112664,"ring_next":30282,"ring_prev":30282},{"basket":{"id":45032,"display_name":"Italy, filmmaking in"},"id":112684,"ring_next":30392,"ring_prev":30306},{"basket":{"id":45036,"display_name":"Japan -- filmmaking in"},"id":112713,"ring_next":30407,"ring_prev":30335},{"basket":{"id":45089,"display_name":"lenses -- zoom"},"id":112834,"ring_next":30373,"ring_prev":30331},{"basket":{"id":45097,"display_name":"Manchurian action films"},"id":112879,"ring_next":30363,"ring_prev":30346},{"basket":{"id":45249,"display_name":"Shin Films -- contract players"},"id":113540,"ring_next":30310,"ring_prev":30338},{"basket":{"id":45257,"display_name":"Shin Films -- as regional studio"},"id":113574,"ring_next":30348,"ring_prev":30335},{"basket":{"id":45270,"display_name":"Shin Sang-ok (Shin), as filmmaker -- directorial work"},"id":113626,"ring_next":30321,"ring_prev":30337},{"basket":{"id":45275,"display_name":"Shin Sang-ok (Shin), as filmmaker -- technical achievements"},"id":113647,"ring_next":30363,"ring_prev":30343},{"basket":{"id":45276,"display_name":"Shin Yŏng-gyun"},"id":113654,"ring_next":30373,"ring_prev":30326},{"basket":{"id":45285,"display_name":"Sŏng Ch'unhyang (film, Shin)"},"id":113695,"ring_next":30348,"ring_prev":30344},{"basket":{"id":45319,"display_name":"Wanderer, The (film, Shin)"},"id":113841,"ring_next":30352,"ring_prev":30346}],"localid":"page_109","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/xhtml/chapter3.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"pg_109\"/>","css_selector":"#pg_109","xpath":"a[@id=\"pg_109\"]"},"next_location_id":30348,"previous_location_id":30346}]
