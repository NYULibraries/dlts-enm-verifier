Thus, the meaning of a metaphor (or symbol) is not a subjective judgment on the part of the reader, but can be arrived at by applying objective criteria, based on an understanding of the human intellect. The argument for the universality of symbols and metaphors establishes the timeless quality of linguistic expression, and renders the Bible and Talmuds as comprehensible, in their own terms, to someone in the nineteenth century as they were to their original audiences.

For the former, prophecy, for example, represents a certain perfection in the nature of the human being, in addition to its dependence on the will of God.44 The prophets, and, for that matter, the sages, are men of speculative insight, who speak in parables specifically designed to conceal the meaning of their words from those whom they might otherwise mislead.45 Thus, for Maimonides, the biblical and rabbinic authors can be seen as philosophers who spoke in parables and riddles.
