In this important way, law and literature practitioners seek to render law more pure in its aspirations. The law and literature perspective attempts to interject humanistic values in law so as to perfect traditional jurisprudential studies.\nLate 1980s Law and Literature Scholarship—Proliferating Literary Discourses\nBy the late 1980s, the influence of law and literature could be found in the work of scholars such as White and Weisberg, who claimed that the law and literature perspective would transform the way legal academics talk and think about law and adjudication. The movement questioned the basic universal assumptions shaping the discursive culture of law by “pointing towards a more overt and ethical use of institutional language.”81 A major shift in theoretical practice occurred as other law and literature practitioners discovered new interpretive strategies within the transformative ideas of critical social theorists such as Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Jean-François Lyotard, and Edward Said. The new interpretive strategies of critical social theory (deconstruction, post-structuralism, postmodernism, neopragmatism) have energized the law and literature movement and broadened its theoretical base. By the late 1980s, law and literature scholars took the “interpretive turn” and began arguing that literature and literary criticism were highly relevant sources for understanding the politics of interpretation.”82 Their interpretive arguments developed from a cultural form of literary criticism that sought to bring out the diverse, multiple discourses that had been silent in legal analysis.83 They claimed that legal interpretation has constrained the “hermeneutic possibilities” in order to maintain and rationalize legal institutions and the social and economic conditions they support.84\nOne interesting manifestation of this involves new imaginative readings of classical literature. Robin West’s imaginative interpretation of Kafka’s THE TRIAL in a widely discussed HARVARD LAW REVIEW article, for example, was used by West to expose the limitations in the mindset of Richard Posner’s ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW.85 According to West, Kafka’s story reveals the ethical failings of the scientific-like analysis "},"document":{"title":"Postmodern Legal Movements","author":"Gary Minda","publisher":"New York University Press","id":93,"isbn":"9780814755112"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1123,"display_name":"Derrida, Jacques"},"id":96724,"ring_next":26368,"ring_prev":26331},{"basket":{"id":38895,"display_name":"Economic Analysis of Law (Posner)"},"id":96752,"ring_next":26395,"ring_prev":26291},{"basket":{"id":9640,"display_name":"Foucault, Michel"},"id":96850,"ring_next":26420,"ring_prev":26320},{"basket":{"id":39021,"display_name":"Interpretation -- interpretive jurisprudence"},"id":96976,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1660,"display_name":"Lyotard, Jean-Francois"},"id":97188,"ring_next":26417,"ring_prev":24142},{"basket":{"id":30018,"display_name":"Posner, Richard A. -- law and literature"},"id":97348,"ring_next":26353,"ring_prev":26347},{"basket":{"id":2404,"display_name":"Said, Edward W."},"id":97501,"ring_next":26420,"ring_prev":24731},{"basket":{"id":39331,"display_name":"Trial, The (Kafka)"},"id":97583,"ring_next":26339,"ring_prev":26339},{"basket":{"id":39342,"display_name":"Weisberg, Richard"},"id":97619,"ring_next":26354,"ring_prev":26347},{"basket":{"id":31516,"display_name":"West, Robin"},"id":97625,"ring_next":26458,"ring_prev":26347},{"basket":{"id":31144,"display_name":"White, James Boyd"},"id":97633,"ring_next":26353,"ring_prev":26347}],"localid":"page_159","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch08.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_159\">","css_selector":"#page_159","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_159\"]"},"next_location_id":26349,"previous_location_id":26347}]
