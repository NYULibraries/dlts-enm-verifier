What replaces these places are facilities and centers—institutions where judgments are passed and fates decided. Sidewalks, parks and abandoned buildings house the homeless human remainder of this dynamic.\nThere are also places, however, where radical forms of hospitality continue to be extended. Sites of radical hospitality can extend no farther than a city block or encompass an entire neighborhood. They offer refuge both to the homeless and to those whose homes lose the capacity to shelter. These are places where visitors are welcomed as citizens of a usually disregarded or unknown city. This is the city of unreal estate—a city that shadows, faintly but fantastically, the city documented on maps, patrolled by authorities, divided into public and private, inhabited and empty, saved and lost.\n\n\n\n"},"document":{"title":"The Unreal Estate Guide to Detroit","author":"Herscher, Andrew","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":15,"isbn":"9780472029174"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_144","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/pt02_chp03.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_144\">","css_selector":"#page_144","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_144\"]"},"next_location_id":3231,"previous_location_id":3229}]
