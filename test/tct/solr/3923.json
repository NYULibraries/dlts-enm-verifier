Hip-hop studies has reinforced this distinction by, all too frequently, isolating hip hop-music and street culture from contemporary art, literature, and cultural criticism. The unsurprising result is that much, but not all, hip-hop scholarship has severed hip-hop from its relationship to African American culture, writ large. Hip-hop culture thus appears to transcend the traditional debates of African American cultural studies as articulated by Du Bois, Locke, Hughes, Hurston, and Gates and articulate the pure perspective or experience of disenfranchised and marginalized African Americans.\nAlthough generally separated by academic scholarship and the public, the forces that shape hip-hop culture also influence contemporary African American art and literature. Increasingly, African American artists and writers make explicit references to hip-hop culture within their work and, like Kehinde Wiley, use hip-hop music to create the context for showing their work. Hip-hop music does not speak simply to the urban working class, but to a broad range of African Americans who are still waiting for legal discourse to deliver on its promises of freedom and equality. Like blues and jazz before it, hip-hop has become a central artistic paradigm for cultural production that cuts across disciplinary boundaries. Contemporary artists and writers rely on sampling, layering, rhythmic asymmetry, and irony in their work. These writers and artists have also become the focus of public controversies and lawsuits regarding their use of racist imagery. In order for scholars to capture the full impact of hip-hop aesthetics, we will need to get beyond the romantic view of working-class culture that underwrites much hip-hop scholarship.25 The debate inaugurated by hip-hop aesthetics involves a broader range of African Americans than typically considered, and it may demand a profound reworking of our understanding of African American culture. Hip-hop's criticism of property law cannot be characterized as a “pure” or “authentic” working-class perspective. Isolating hip-hop as the music of poor urban youth in effect marginalizes its critique and encourages class and generational conflict. It also decontextualizes the many African American writers and artists who have engaged with similar questions, albeit from different cultural and professional locations. By linking generations and art forms, scholars and intellectuals can foster community building around shared political, economic, and cultural concerns.\nAlthough Chuck D described rap as “Black America's CNN,” hip-hop studies should not mistake the music, art, and literature of the post-Civil Rights era for unmediated realism.26 Grandmaster Flash and the Furious "},"document":{"title":"Parodies of Ownership: Hip-Hop Aesthetics and Intellectual Property Law","author":"Schur, Richard L.","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press and The University of Michigan Library","id":18,"isbn":"9780472024490"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":5569,"display_name":"Blues"},"id":16461,"ring_next":3751,"ring_prev":3915},{"basket":{"id":5589,"display_name":"Chuck D"},"id":16507,"ring_next":3922,"ring_prev":3922},{"basket":{"id":5673,"display_name":"Du Bois, W.E.B."},"id":16892,"ring_next":3740,"ring_prev":3911},{"basket":{"id":5704,"display_name":"Gates, Henry Louis, Jr."},"id":16996,"ring_next":22716,"ring_prev":29728},{"basket":{"id":5717,"display_name":"Grandmaster Flash (hip-hop performer)"},"id":17046,"ring_next":29009,"ring_prev":3787},{"basket":{"id":5737,"display_name":"Hip-hop -- Generation"},"id":17111,"ring_next":3928,"ring_prev":3879},{"basket":{"id":5747,"display_name":"Hip-hop -- Relation to high culture"},"id":17207,"ring_next":3938,"ring_prev":3920},{"basket":{"id":5751,"display_name":"Hughes, Langston"},"id":17231,"ring_next":9065,"ring_prev":3911},{"basket":{"id":44329,"display_name":"Hurston, Zora Neale"},"id":17237,"ring_next":9094,"ring_prev":3791},{"basket":{"id":5790,"display_name":"Jazz"},"id":17377,"ring_next":3751,"ring_prev":3915},{"basket":{"id":5827,"display_name":"Locke, Alain"},"id":17472,"ring_next":24498,"ring_prev":3911},{"basket":{"id":5910,"display_name":"Post–Civil Rights era -- Cultural production"},"id":17871,"ring_next":3769,"ring_prev":3913},{"basket":{"id":5931,"display_name":"Property rights -- Within African American life"},"id":18074,"ring_next":3925,"ring_prev":3920},{"basket":{"id":6046,"display_name":"Wiley, Kehinde"},"id":18474,"ring_next":3812,"ring_prev":3911}],"localid":"page_185","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap7.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_185\">","css_selector":"#page_185","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_185\"]"},"next_location_id":3924,"previous_location_id":3922}]
