In a way, this is a disintermediation of the elite influencers—commodifying their social capital—and a reintermediation of that influencing process with an agency specializing in the task. Instead of courting a relatively few A-list writers who are highly valued for their ability to have their choice of topics echoed by many other writers, the lesser writers can be purchased directly (and perhaps more simply and cheaply).\nEven for prominent writers who would decline an explicit pay-for-placement deal, the many ways linkage can be purchased (literally or metaphorically) leads to controversy over proper behavior. For example, one company, FON, set off a round of discussion by having many advisory board members who were also widely read Web writers.11 But the tiny company also got publicity from another source: influential commentators on the Internet who write blogs—including some who may be compensated in the future for advising FON about its business. Though an appropriate journalistic disclosure was made almost everywhere in this case, the aspect in which the social was intermingling with the commercial remained unsettling. A focus on disclaimers often assumes a certain background in separation and avoidance of conflict of interest and is insufficient when those strictures are no longer in place. While blurring the lines between business and friendship is not at all a new problem, the shifting systems of attention sorting and seeking are now bringing these issues to notice in new contexts.\nTo put it simply, there's an old joke that runs as follows:\nBILLIONAIRE TO WOMAN: Would you have sex with me for a million dollars?\nWOMAN: Well... yes.\nBILLIONAIRE: Would you have sex with me for ten dollars?\nWOMAN: What kind of a girl do you think I am?\nBILLIONAIRE: We've already determined that. Now we're just arguing over the price.\nTwo factors make up the humor in this joke: commerce itself and amount. The obvious aspect of the joke is that there are two categories of interactions, commercial and social, between which there is not supposed to be any overlap, regardless of the dollar amount at stake. A less-often-remarked aspect is that there is indeed a “class” division between high-priced commercial and low-priced commercial.\n"},"document":{"title":"The Hyperlinked Society: Questioning Connections in the Digital Age","author":"Turrow, Joseph; Tsui, Lokman","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":32,"isbn":"9780472024537"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":30,"display_name":"blogs"},"id":30499,"ring_next":6892,"ring_prev":6869},{"basket":{"id":9637,"display_name":"FON"},"id":30810,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":9755,"display_name":"Mediation"},"id":31214,"ring_next":6967,"ring_prev":6870},{"basket":{"id":9851,"display_name":"Publicity"},"id":31615,"ring_next":7056,"ring_prev":6887}],"localid":"page_115","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap06.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_115\">","css_selector":"#page_115","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_115\"]"},"next_location_id":6891,"previous_location_id":6889}]
