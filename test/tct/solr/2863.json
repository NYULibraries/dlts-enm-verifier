Who really knows how a book—like the cell’s mitochondria—fuels the reader-writer’s art? The writer’s white lie might well be told in service of literary altruism. After all, submitting this list for public display means offering a cerebral model of what we might become if only we weren’t so inclined to toss aside Middlemarch for the venal pleasures of South Park. Such lists become breathless tours akin to those of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, trotting out the hallowed books like so many gold-plated sinks and tubs. “Oh,” the list-reader is meant to sigh, “if only I . . .”\nAesthetic Fisticuffs, Red Wine, and LPs\nWriters’ usual discussions of their favorite books and authors invoke a vastly different scene. Its innocuous start involves dinner, a drink or two, and casual book chat. That calm discourse veers quickly into a chaos-symphony of screeching, table-banging, red-faced rants favoring one author over another held in abject, boundless disdain. It’s a messy, bread-crumbed, wine-spilled, and refreshingly human interchange. And it reveals one’s literary allegiances to be visceral. Yes, personal, rooted, and ultimately meaningful—but probably as peculiarly indefensible as one’s devotion to the Cubs. What Cubs fan’s ever accused of being rational?\nSome of my most cherished graduate school memories revolve around these arguments in the beer-drenched kitchen, a gaggle of us hovering near the huge-bellied avocado refrigerator crammed with sale-priced, longneck Blatz. One poet pal argues spittingly for the preeminence of Wallace Stevens as America’s Greatest Poet. Another puts forward his booted foot thumping William Carlos Williams as the Savior of American Verse. Part theater and part lecture hall, the scene drags on with no intermission or class bell to welcome-halt the vaudevillian action. Only one force is powerful enough to overcome such poetic bombast. Beneath the long night’s coat, that force arrives in dribs and drabs, unnoticed amidst the stereo’s blare and luorescent’s bent-back hum, creeping unseen like Poe’s evil visitor in “The Masque of the Red Death.” Then someone opens the refrigerator door, and out it leaps at the assembled debaters’ dry throats. The refrigerator’s empty. Then, a chorus of mumbling, handfuls of soggy chips, the pretzeled path to a screen door banging Bacchanalian detritus. Good nights, handshakes, sloppy kisses. Outside, the night sky reminds us how tiny our hands and our resumes.\n"},"document":{"title":"Poetry's Afterlife: Verse in the Digital Age","author":"Stein, Kevin","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":14,"isbn":"9780472026708"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":4375,"display_name":"Aesthetic -- distance, proximity to art"},"id":12751,"ring_next":2906,"ring_prev":2925},{"basket":{"id":4478,"display_name":"Chicago Cubs"},"id":12933,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":4729,"display_name":"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous"},"id":13391,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":29941,"display_name":"Eliot, George, writings -- Middlemarch"},"id":13460,"ring_next":7980,"ring_prev":19968},{"basket":{"id":44331,"display_name":"Poe, Edgar Allan"},"id":13611,"ring_next":2880,"ring_prev":29683},{"basket":{"id":4947,"display_name":"South Park, television animated comedy"},"id":13760,"ring_next":2928,"ring_prev":3016},{"basket":{"id":4958,"display_name":"Stevens, Wallace"},"id":13783,"ring_next":2864,"ring_prev":2828},{"basket":{"id":5018,"display_name":"Williams, William Carlos"},"id":13877,"ring_next":2872,"ring_prev":2827},{"basket":{"id":5048,"display_name":"Wright, James -- working class roots"},"id":13949,"ring_next":2962,"ring_prev":2839},{"basket":{"id":5060,"display_name":"Wright, James -- \"The Continental Can Company at Six O'Clock\" (unpublished draft)"},"id":13988,"ring_next":2962,"ring_prev":3064}],"localid":"page_46","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap3.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_46\">","css_selector":"#page_46","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_46\"]"},"next_location_id":2864,"previous_location_id":2862}]
