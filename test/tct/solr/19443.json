But as the idea settled over the next few weeks, I realized that my reaction was typical of women’s response: even with some knowledge of the facts, I was moving from fear to paralysis to hiding. It was then that I realized, both for myself personally and for all the rest of us, that the only way we can come out of hiding, break through our paralyzing defenses, is to know the full extent of sexual violence and domination of women. It is knowledge from which we have pulled back, as well as knowledge that has been withheld from us. In knowing, in facing directly, we can learn how to chart our course out of this oppression, by envisioning and creating a world which will preclude female sexual slavery. In knowing the extent of our oppression we will have to discover some of the ways to begin immediately breaking the deadly cycle of fear, denial-through-hiding, and slavery.\nFar from being the project I feared facing, the research, study, and writing of this book [Female Sexual Slavery] have given me knowledge that forces me to think beyond confinement of women’s oppression. Understanding the scope and depth of female sexual slavery makes it intolerable to passively live with it any longer. I had to realistically visualize a world that would preclude this enslavement by projecting some ways out of it. Reading about sexual slavery makes hope and vision necessary.\nThat was 1979.\nBecause I found it painful to write about this fact of women’s lives, for the next decade, the 1980s, I tried to shift some of my work into other areas. In 1980, just after my book Female Sexual Slavery was published, I conducted meetings on this issue at the 1980 Mid—Decade of Women Conference in Copenhagen, from which came an international feminist meeting held in Rotterdam in 1983. I am grateful to Barbara Good for her networking that led now Senator Barbara Mikulski to initiate a resolution we drafted on prostitution that was adopted in the 1980 U.N. Conference in Copenhagen, a significant boost to this work. But launching international feminist political action to confront sexual exploitation also brought out the proprostitution lobby—organizations and individuals who actively promote prostitution—who "},"document":{"title":"The Prostitution of Sexuality","author":"Kathleen Barry","publisher":"New york University Press","id":73,"isbn":"9780814712771"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":28815,"display_name":"Female Sexual Slavery (Barry)"},"id":74306,"ring_next":19446,"ring_prev":19442},{"basket":{"id":29063,"display_name":"Mid-Decade of Women Conference (1980)"},"id":74687,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":29212,"display_name":"Proprostitution -- lobby"},"id":74961,"ring_next":19444,"ring_prev":19449}],"localid":"page_2","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/introduction.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_2\">","css_selector":"#page_2","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_2\"]"},"next_location_id":19444,"previous_location_id":19442}]
