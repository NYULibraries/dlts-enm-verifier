The Almighty has no attribute which can take side with us in such a contest.1\n\nBut the ambivalence of men like Jefferson would become increasingly rare as the movement toward abolition intensified, yielding to a certainty that black slavery was Creation’s plan. James Henry Hammond of South Carolina was one of slavery’s most vigorous defenders. On February 1, 1836, Representative Hammond offered Congress the increasingly typical defense of slavery: it was part of Creation’s plan. “The doom of Ham has been branded on the form and features of his African descendants,” Hammond explained. “The hand of fate has united his color and his destiny. Man cannot separate what God hath joined.”\nAnd Creation’s plan was a benevolent one. In January 1840, William Cost Johnson, a Whig congressman from Maryland, informed the House that it was “a blessing to the colored race to keep them in slavery. . . . In [Africa], they were little more intelligent than the ourang outang species; but now they had become a civilized and Christianized people.”\nThe attitudes grew hardened, the racism more intense, as the sectional rift pointed increasingly toward dissolution. By the time it came, black inferiority was at the fulcrum. Alexander Stephens, vice president of the Confederate States of America, declared in March 1861 that the Confederacy “rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery—subordination to the superior race—is his natural and normal condition.”\nThe failure of that government to secure its cause did not change the attitudes of its constituents. Thus a prominent Virginian could still proclaim of slavery in June 1865 that “for the slave it is the best condition in every way that has been devised.” Henry W. Ravenel, South Carolina’s great “benevolent” master, could still insist that slavery “had received the divine sanction & was the best condition in which the two races could live together for mutual benefit.”2\nIt is unsurprising, perhaps, that neither civil war nor emancipation settled the question of the black man’s rank in the natural order. But neither, really, did Reconstruction. Many of the founders of modern equality—the framers of the Reconstruction effort—professed their belief in the inherent superiority of the white race to all other races, and of men to women.
