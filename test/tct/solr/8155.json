Still others, like Lyndon Johnson, appreciate the major question but become distracted by other issues and wind up being unsuccessful. I discuss this issue in the context of candidates’ judgment and leadership in chapter 8.\nSome Issues regarding Assessment of Psychological Suitability\nQuestions of what can be learned about presidential candidates and how can we learn it are central to my analysis. However, the issues raised by a conceptual and theoretical focus on psychological suitability are complex. They are also likely to be controversial. Is the concept of psychological suitability inherently normative? Can some systematic theoretical basis for it be developed that would guide our observations? To what psychological elements and political skills does the term psychological suitability refer? What evidence is there that these elements and skills are important, and in what context and ways can they be assessed?\nAssessing psychological suitability in the context of presidential campaigns raises additional theoretical and practical difficulties. Presidential candidates and their advisers have a vested interest in showing themselves as they would like to be seen, not necessarily as they are. The psychologically minded observer must find a set of theoretical levers and methods that allow the penetration of the candidate’s campaign persona to gain a clearer understanding of the person behind it.\nIn doing so, an analyst must be careful. A candidate’s campaign persona may not be a fully representative or accurate portrayal of the candidate, but that does not mean that is patently false. The analyzing observer must try to develop the theoretical means to distinguish the real from the contrived.\nThe analysis of psychological suitability within the context of presidential campaigns is particularly subject to the dangers of subjective and biased evaluations by the analyst. Does the analyst favor one political party’s approach to government over another’s? Does he or she dislike certain character elements and favor others? Does the analyst assume that all politicians are liars or, alternatively, that leaders should be saviors?\nFinally, there are also two sets of questions that arise in connection with the application of these theories to presidential campaigns, even if a theoretical and observational basis for proceeding with them can be found. One set is ethical, the other practical. Can a reasonable ethical justification for conducting such analyses be developed? Are there any limits to such "},"document":{"title":"The Psychological Assessment of Presidential Candidates","author":"Stanley A.
