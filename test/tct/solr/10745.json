He felt that a stranger’s unspoken judgment could change him into an outcast, a dehumanized, broken thing, empty of mind and feeling, living on dust. Imagining that he was in danger of becoming one of “those who no longer hear their wills going in the noise” of the city, he thought he understood the fear that seemed to have “grown” “over” Parisians who were “beginning to read things differently from the way they were meant” (Letters 1:110-11). As his sense of self, distinctive identity, and autonomy became painfully uncertain and the “noise” of the city threatened to engulf him, he began to doubt his ability to distinguish fantasy from objective reality.\nWriting the novel for which these experiences provided raw material helped the poet to master them and thus to defend himself against the illness that was threatening to destroy his sanity. In retrospect he believed the book was “something like an underpinning” for all the work that followed. It had opened up “a whole octave” of poetry in him. As a result of his writing The Notebooks, “everything reaches farther up” and “almost all songs are possible” (Letters 1:361).\nHaving received a commission to write a monograph on Auguste Rodin, Rilke came to Paris late in August 1902 to meet the sculptor. His two essays on the Frenchman (published in 1903 and 1907 as parts 1 and 2 of a book entitled Rodin) study Rodin’s decompositions and reconstructions of the physical world and illuminate his fascination with Rodin’s art at the time he was having the fantasies of disintegration described in the letters and in The Notebooks. In this sculpture he discovered that the “artist has the right to make one thing out of many and a world out of the smallest part of a thing.”6 This model licensed, inspired, and shaped his fictional evocations of the fantasies which had been so frightening to him. Thus, a sculptor became his “master” during the years in which his writing matured and established his place among leading modern writers with the completion of the New Poems (1907 and 1908) and The Notebooks (1910), though Rodin’s personal hold on Rilke began to decline after a temporary rupture in the relationship in May 1906. This part of the story is told in chapter 8.\nRodin’s example may have helped Rilke to discover, or at least to accept, the fragmentary form of his novel, the fractured personality of his central character, and the apparent incoherence of a life presented “as if one found disordered papers in a drawer” (Letters 1:362). A similar influence on The Notebooks was Paul Cézanne, whose painting also provided "},"document":{"title":"The Beginning of Terror","author":"David Kleinbard","publisher":"New York University Press","id":44,"isbn":"9780814746677"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":16303,"display_name":"Cézanne, Paul"},"id":45592,"ring_next":10762,"ring_prev":10937},{"basket":{"id":16350,"display_name":"Disintegration -- fantasies of"},"id":45693,"ring_next":10775,"ring_prev":10848},{"basket":{"id":16298,"display_name":"Engulfment"},"id":45744,"ring_next":10747,"ring_prev":10961},{"basket":{"id":16561,"display_name":"Narcissus -- in Sonnet II"},"id":46197,"ring_next":10868,"ring_prev":10868},{"basket":{"id":16675,"display_name":"Rilke's writings -- New Poems (Neue Gedichte)"},"id":46529,"ring_next":10751,"ring_prev":10968},{"basket":{"id":16270,"display_name":"Rodin, Auguste"},"id":46682,"ring_next":10749,"ring_prev":19070},{"basket":{"id":16770,"display_name":"Sense of self in Rilke"},"id":46836,"ring_next":10747,"ring_prev":10935},{"basket":{"id":16776,"display_name":"Sense of self in Rilke -- alienation"},"id":46856,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":16777,"display_name":"Sense of self in Rilke -- autonomy"},"id":46857,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":16780,"display_name":"Sense of self in Rilke -- identity"},"id":46860,"ring_next":10792,"ring_prev":10933}],"localid":"page_3","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch01.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_3\">","css_selector":"#page_3","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_3\"]"},"next_location_id":10746,"previous_location_id":10744}]
