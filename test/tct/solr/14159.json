[{"id":14159,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"55-page_135","content_descriptor":"page 135","text":"The schizoid problem is the fear of love, whose (oral) voraciousness is felt to be dangerous, liable to eat the other up. In the primitive unconscious the worst infant fantasy is that of the primal scene: sexual intercourse is felt by the child to be a form of voracious eating, in which the parents may consume one another or, in combination, threaten to turn on the child. I have suggested that some of the menacing elements in Victorian fantasy and around woman in Dickens have their roots in such primitive fantasies. The way in which such fears are alleviated is by mutual “finding”—by finding the reality of the other, and by making good (reparative) relationships: by developing love.\nIn Great Expectations there do seem to be recurring fantasies of the primal scene, of sex between father and mother, which is full of danger. (Estella’s parents were criminals, one a murderess.) And in general, we might suggest, the intense guilt that surrounded libidinal sexuality in Victorian England was bound up with the dread of the primal scene as dangerous: one often detects a threat of murder behind Victorian sexuality, and murder certainly pervades this novel in association with sex—with Compeyson, the murderess, Miss Havisham, Orlick, and Bentley Drummle (it is there, too, of course, in the menace of Bradley Headstone in Our Mutual Friend, as we shall see).\nDickens’s secret sexual relationship with Ellen Ternan and his fear of exposure, as well as his guilt over how he had treated his wife and family, no doubt exacerbated these unconscious fears. His own sexual experiences must have been full of guilt and dread. But we are dealing also with very deep unconscious fears about gender and sexuality, such as we often find in the Victorian consciousness (as, for instance, in the fantasies of George MacDonald and the schizoid flights of fancy of Lewis Carroll). And we may examine it in existentialist terms as the search for a sense of secure being and individuation in relation to sexual perplexity.\nAs I have suggested in discussing reparation, it is a problem of “concern,” of finding the other without eating her up or being eaten, of finding a confidence in encounter in which the other can be allowed to freely exist in her own right. Pip is seeking the capacity successfully to make reparation in the face of the fear of what love might do, and his problem may be associated with unconscious dread of the consequences of loving. I hope such an approach will not be felt to be reductive. It is by no means to reduce Dicken’s creative symbolism to say that the murder of Nancy is the “primal scene,” any more than I was trying to reduce Mahler when I said "},"document":{"title":"Charles Dickens and the Image of Woman","author":"David Holbrook","publisher":"New York University Press","id":55,"isbn":"9780814735282"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":21316,"display_name":"Being -- secure"},"id":57332,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21358,"display_name":"Carroll, Lewis"},"id":57403,"ring_next":14178,"ring_prev":14087},{"basket":{"id":21396,"display_name":"Concern"},"id":57481,"ring_next":14163,"ring_prev":14163},{"basket":{"id":21568,"display_name":"Fear of love"},"id":57827,"ring_next":14029,"ring_prev":14029},{"basket":{"id":21581,"display_name":"Finding, mutual"},"id":57843,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21599,"display_name":"Gender -- unconscious fears regarding"},"id":57888,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21616,"display_name":"Guilt -- associated with sex"},"id":57925,"ring_next":14082,"ring_prev":14087},{"basket":{"id":21617,"display_name":"Guilt -- of Dickens"},"id":57927,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21677,"display_name":"Illicit passion -- in Dickens"},"id":58032,"ring_next":14188,"ring_prev":14151},{"basket":{"id":15479,"display_name":"Individuation"},"id":58057,"ring_next":18214,"ring_prev":14156},{"basket":{"id":21696,"display_name":"Infantile fantasies -- of primal scene"},"id":58070,"ring_next":14026,"ring_prev":14026},{"basket":{"id":21792,"display_name":"Love -- unconscious dread of consequences of"},"id":58280,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21799,"display_name":"MacDonald, George -- fantasies of"},"id":58294,"ring_next":14179,"ring_prev":14152},{"basket":{"id":21804,"display_name":"Mahler, Gustav"},"id":58316,"ring_next":14168,"ring_prev":14168},{"basket":{"id":21901,"display_name":"Murder -- preoccupation with, in Great Expec tations"},"id":58502,"ring_next":14162,"ring_prev":14154},{"basket":{"id":21934,"display_name":"Others -- finding reality of"},"id":58566,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21935,"display_name":"Our Mutual Friend (Dickens)"},"id":58570,"ring_next":14171,"ring_prev":14151},{"basket":{"id":21977,"display_name":"Primal scene -- infant fantasy of"},"id":58649,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22025,"display_name":"Relationships -- reparative"},"id":58734,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":5944,"display_name":"Reparations"},"id":58752,"ring_next":14191,"ring_prev":14155},{"basket":{"id":22062,"display_name":"Schizoid problem -- in Great Expecta* tions"},"id":58818,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22097,"display_name":"Sexual intercourse -- as voracious eating"},"id":58872,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22119,"display_name":"Sexuality -- guilt regarding"},"id":58901,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22123,"display_name":"Sexuality -- unconscious fears regarding"},"id":58905,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22177,"display_name":"Ternan, Ellen"},"id":59021,"ring_next":14188,"ring_prev":14151},{"basket":{"id":22201,"display_name":"Unconscious, the -- primitive"},"id":59070,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22214,"display_name":"Victorian fantasy, menacing elements in"},"id":59089,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":21903,"display_name":"Murder -- in Victorian sexuality"},"id":59106,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":22238,"display_name":"Voraciousness"},"id":59134,"ring_next":14026,"ring_prev":14075},{"basket":{"id":22269,"display_name":"Woman -- menacing elements around"},"id":59203,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_135","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch05.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_135\">","css_selector":"#page_135","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_135\"]"},"next_location_id":14160,"previous_location_id":14158}]
