The gratitude is shortlived because we learn quickly that Hegel “delayed atheism dangerously by persuading us of the divinity of existence where Schopenhauer’s unconditional and honest atheism at least made the ungodliness of existence palpable and indisputable” (307). But America becomes an experimental site because it is the place of acting and role playing—a concept developed by Nietzsche for America or by America for Nietzsche. At this point or place Nietzsche links experimentation with improv techniques—something of which I have availed myself for this presentation. In any case, the dimension of scientificity underscoring the gay science is related to exploration and discovery, though discovery is not seen simply as “inventing” but rather as discovering what was already there, inhabited, which is why Nietzsche has recourse sometimes to the discovery of America—an event, an experiment that did not occur without its risks. The experimentor must give up any secure anchoring in a homeland, allow herself to be directed by an accidental current rather than a preestablished goal. This accidental current nonetheless becomes the groove for a voyage taken without any helmsman, without any commander, Nietzsche insists. And now, to the accidental discovery of America.\nThere have been ages when men believed with rigid confidence, even with piety, in their predestination for precisely one particular occupation. But there are opposite ages to those of durability (“and duration is a first-rate value on earth”); they are really democratic, and a certain cocky faith advances more and more into the foreground—”the Athenian faith that first becomes noticeable in the Periclean age, the faith of the Americans to day that is more and more becoming the European faith as well: namely, the individual becomes convinced that he can do just about everything and can manage any role, and everybody experiments with himself, improvises, makes new experiments, enjoys his experiments; and all nature ceases and becomes art.” The jack-of-all-trades (an American translation of the Renaissance man) is an American symptom rebounding to Europe, the bright flipside of which we could count as the art of improv and experimentation, including performance art and jazz (music was always with science "},"document":{"title":"Deconstruction is/in America","author":"Anselm Haverkamp","publisher":"New York University Press","id":50,"isbn":"9780814735190"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_215","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch12.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_215\">","css_selector":"#page_215","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_215\"]"},"next_location_id":12787,"previous_location_id":12785}]
