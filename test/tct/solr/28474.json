According to the dominant political rhetoric, immigration laws failed to protect U.S. citizens from an overwhelming influx of undesirable immigrants who, unlike previous generations of newcomers, were reluctant to blend in with the majority culture and contribute to the economy. Politicians frequently referred to this seemingly unprecedented crisis in their calls for immediate and drastic immigration reform measures. For example, when Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) spoke in favor of the Immigration Control and Financial Responsibility Act of 1996 (S. 1664), he argued that immigrants “put a crippling strain on the American education system” and placed a burden on taxpayers by committing crimes, displacing U.S. workers, and using public welfare services, including emergency medical care (United States Congress, Senate, April 25, 1996). In a carefully worded remark (interspersed with proclamations that he was neither anti-immigrant nor racist), Senator Shelby also contended that current immigrants were less desirable because they were culturally and ethnically different from “our domestic population” and were thus slower to assimilate, especially in a society where “multiculturalism is favored over the ‘melting pot’ concept” (United States Congress, Senate, April 25, 1996).\nOver time, many have pushed to reduce overall admissions and reform admission criteria because of the changing cultural and ethnic heritage of immigrants; this idea is far from original. In the late nineteenth century, the New York Times expressed a similar concern over the increasing number of Eastern and Southeastern European immigrants. In an article from 1892, the New York Times argued that past generations of Northwestern European immigrants “were readily assimilated and made good citizens.” However, with a new wave of immigrants, “new and unclean fountains burst in the east and southeast, the swelling streams pouring in a people wholly "},"document":{"title":"Model Immigrants and Undesirable Aliens","author":"Christina Gerken","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","id":100,"isbn":"9780816686353"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_1","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/ump-gerkenebook-0005.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"p1\" class=\"page\" />","css_selector":"#p1","xpath":"a[@id=\"p1\"]"},"next_location_id":28475,"previous_location_id":28473}]
