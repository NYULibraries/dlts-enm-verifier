The conversation turned to Local 560, and the following exchange took place:\nA. SALERNO: But they threw everybody out of office there.\nSABATO: Yeah, they’re all out.\nA. SALERNO: Everybody’s out.\nSABATO: They’re all out.\nA. SALERNO: So how can you control it?\nSABATO: What do you mean? They got the control in there.\nA. SALERNO: Who is that now?\nSABATO: Matty (Ianniello).\nA. SALERNO: Oh, we got a guy in there?\nSABATO: Sure.\nThese taped conversations must be viewed in the light of the facts disclosed in the 1984 Local 560 No. 1 opinion. When so viewed there can be no doubt that the Genovese Organized Crime Family intended to maintain its control over Local 560 during the pendency of the appeal from Judge Ackerman’s March 16, 1984 Judgment Order, during any period of trusteeship and thereafter. I concluded after the first preliminary injunction hearing and I conclude now that the tapes constitute strong evidence that this control was to be exercised through Anthony Salerno’s caporegime Matthew Ianniello and that Ianniello, upon the advice of Stephen Andretta, selected Michael Sciarra to be the man on the scene at Local 560 to whom orders and instructions could be given.\nThus, notwithstanding the issuance of the March 16, 1984 Judgment Order and the appointment of a trustee on June 23, 1986 the Provenzano Group as it existed in 1984 and as its personnel changed somewhat during the years that followed, never ceased the unlawful conduct described in Judge Ackerman’s opinion in Local 560 No. 1.\n* * *\nAfter March 16, 1984 Sciarra continued to profess his loyalty to Anthony Provenzano and could not bring himself to disavow the criminal and other unlawful tactics of the Provenzano Group nor to admit the existence of the Provenzano Group conspiracy and Genovese Family involvement in the affairs of Local 560. As recently as September 24, 1989, Sciarra, then a Local 560 business agent, proclaimed to an enthusiastic Local 560 membership his love for Provenzano. I do not take seriously Sciarra’s belated mea culpa delivered on July 17, 1990 at the conclusion of the trial in this matter. That declaration, like so many of Sciarra’s statements over the years, was designed to meet his needs of the moment.\nMost of the evidence in this case was introduced at the 1988 preliminary injunction hearing. That evidence disclosed actions on Sciarra’s past which tied him "},"document":{"title":"Busting the Mob","author":"James B.
