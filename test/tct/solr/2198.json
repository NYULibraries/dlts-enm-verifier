Each believed that its claims trumped those of the other’s, but the contest was not one that could be adjudicated in rational terms. Post-colonial development extended this dynamic, by virtue of the demands of modernization, with the difference that voters could now elect who would govern them. The idea of a split public grasps this process of productive misrecognition as a key dialectic shaping and reshaping these agonistic spaces (Rajagopal, 2001).\nSpectacle, Commodity, and the Labor of Seeing\nWe have seen that the teleological thrust of most varieties of media studies order themselves by technology (e.g., print, radio, cinema, television). Below, I speculate on what media, both as perceptual ensemble, and as furthering market logics, that is, as both technology and commodity, might reveal about emergent postcolonial political forms.\nA noteworthy critical argument that theorized the shift in the character of visuality in late capitalism is Guy Debord’s Society of the Spectacle, a text that continues to resonate more than a half century after it was written. Debord argued that everyday life had dissolved into a series of spectacles that claimed to unify the world through their representation of it. The spectacle was an extension of the commodity, he wrote, and as such was an expression of the alienation of expressive from productive life and of capital’s domination over living labor. However, the distinguishing feature of the society of the spectacle, as Debord defined it, was that the commodity had succeeded in completely colonizing social life, so that commodification was coterminous with the known world (Debord, 1995).\nDebord’s argument linked knowledge and power as they manifested in the domain of perception. The spectacle claimed a fullness of representation, offering a transparent window onto the world. What the spectacle made visible was real, and what was invisible in the spectacle was neither real nor salient. The power of the spectacle was in fact that of regulating perception, of distinguishing between what was worth seeing and what could be ignored. Where the logic of commodification had extended to every sphere of life, what was excluded from the spectacle becomes insignificant, in this argument.\nDebord’s argument embedded visual perception (which in the Renaissance conception of seeing, presumed agency as a component) with a fairly durable epistemic regime where the scope for anyone to intervene was limited at best.15 This was because, according to Debord, extensive\n"},"document":{"title":"Internationalizing “International Communication”","author":"Lee, Chin-Chuan","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":11,"isbn":"9780472120789"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":2143,"display_name":"Capitalism -- Late capitalism"},"id":6491,"ring_next":2200,"ring_prev":2200},{"basket":{"id":2307,"display_name":"Market"},"id":7537,"ring_next":2199,"ring_prev":2195}],"localid":"page_311","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter15.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_311\">","css_selector":"#page_311","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_311\"]"},"next_location_id":2199,"previous_location_id":2197}]
