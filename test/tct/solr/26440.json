Each of these new disciplinary families of jurisprudence are studied to learn about different cultural, linguistic, and theoretical perspectives for legal studies, as they attempt to modernize the dead styles of legal modernism. Generation X is confronted with fragmented and somewhat confusing images and stories about law. These diverse images and stories require the current generation of law students to think more explicitly about the difficulties and opportunities of reaching agreement and consensus in a multicultural world. The experience of this may be unsettling and may even be described as being schizophrenic. The “schizophrenia” of modern jurisprudence, however, may be another signification of the breakdown in the recycling chain of modern discourse.12\nUnlike legal moderns who have become increasingly cynical, postmodern legal critics remain optimistic. They point to the increased academic interest in new scholarly movements as a healthy and hopeful development for legal studies.13 They argue that these movements have become part of the established landscape at the legal academy, and now allow excluded groups to participate in the discourse of jurisprudence. They note how initial fears and claims of protest are giving way to resignation and an overall upbeat mood.14 While these movements have provoked considerable anxiety, postmoderns seek to show how they have helped to discover new insights about law and how their criticism has stimulated new intellectual activity at the law school. They encourage the current generation to rethink basic jurisprudential assumptions and premises.\nThe good news is that there is new energy and interest in the legal academy focusing on questions of jurisprudence. Annual meetings of the Association of American. Law Schools and various leading legal symposiums now focus on postmodern interpretive strategies, as well as the American Law Institute’s Restatements of the Law. Law professors argue about the pitfalls of deconstruction and narrative pedagogy, as well as common law distinctions of bailment and suretyship. These changes in academic discourse and interest are symptomatic of larger changes. The new movements in jurisprudence, unlike jurisprudence of the post-World War II generation, have helped foster a new form of jurisprudence without fixed foundations and formal boundaries.\n"},"document":{"title":"Postmodern Legal Movements","author":"Gary Minda","publisher":"New York University Press","id":93,"isbn":"9780814755112"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":38767,"display_name":"American Law Institute"},"id":96502,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":25642,"display_name":"Association of American Law Schools"},"id":96518,"ring_next":26526,"ring_prev":26301},{"basket":{"id":39249,"display_name":"Post-World War II generation"},"id":97406,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_251","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch13_con.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_251\">","css_selector":"#page_251","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_251\"]"},"next_location_id":26441,"previous_location_id":26439}]
