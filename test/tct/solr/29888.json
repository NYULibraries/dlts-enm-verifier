While this shift toward the marketization of slum land to facilitate urban development has been gradual—having first been identified as a potential strategy in the PMGP—the DRP reflects its culmination. It reflects the embrace of entrepreneurial approaches to urban governance, in which local policy agendas shift toward supporting capital accumulation by the private sector. Although the process by which the Mumbai government embraced this strategy is rooted in changes under way in the local and national political economies—as much as a global transformation—it resonates with Harvey’s analysis of similar shifts under way in a diverse set of cities since the late 1970s. Harvey writes:\n      \n        Deindustrialisation, widespread and seemingly ‘structural’ unemployment, fiscal austerity at both the local and national levels, all coupled with a rising tide of neoconservatism and much stronger appeal (though stronger in theory than in practice) to market rationality and privatisation, provide a backdrop to understanding why so many urban governments, often of quite different political persuasions and armed with very different legal and political powers, have all taken a broadly similar direction. (1989, 5)\n      \n      In the case of Mumbai, the particular political persuasions have been reshaped by a series of multiscalar shifts that include economic liberalization, the challenges to long-standing Congress Party power, the rise of Hindu nationalist politics and associated urban violence, the criminalization of land development, and the emergence of a pro-growth coalition comprising the city’s business elite and officials in the state government.\n      From Labor to Land\n      The changing objectives from slum improvement to property development have paralleled the city’s shifting political economy. Amid Mumbai’s deindustrialization and changing economic composition, the state has become less accepting of slums. While the presence and proliferation of slums had been “supportively neglected” throughout the city’s hundred-year period of industrial development, tolerance for residential informality has diminished as the land on which slums sit has become more and more valuable. In addition to deindustrialization and the movement of manufacturing facilities out of the city, this shift has been facilitated by the creation of a new political economy of land. Land speculation has long been a part of Mumbai’s economic geography—given the island city’s limited supply of land and its poor transit linkages to the main"},"document":{"title":"The Durable Slum","author":"Liza Weinstein","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","id":108,"isbn":"9780816683109"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":44600,"display_name":"Expression of Interest (EOI) document"},"id":110949,"ring_next":29903,"ring_prev":29936},{"basket":{"id":44602,"display_name":"Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)"},"id":110959,"ring_next":29935,"ring_prev":29868},{"basket":{"id":44778,"display_name":"planning and land use"},"id":111420,"ring_next":29891,"ring_prev":29886},{"basket":{"id":44734,"display_name":"Shiv Sena party"},"id":111543,"ring_next":29907,"ring_prev":29886},{"basket":{"id":44746,"display_name":"Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA)"},"id":111579,"ring_next":29892,"ring_prev":29880},{"basket":{"id":44747,"display_name":"Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRS)"},"id":111596,"ring_next":29926,"ring_prev":29886},{"basket":{"id":44770,"display_name":"Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)"},"id":111685,"ring_next":29875,"ring_prev":29875}],"localid":"page_112","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/ump-weinstein-0014.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"p112\" class=\"page\" />","css_selector":"#p112","xpath":"a[@id=\"p112\"]"},"next_location_id":29889,"previous_location_id":29887}]
