Employing it as a critical location from which to theorize about womanhood, female identity, and sexuality, I recently taught an undergraduate course called Redefining Womanhood: (Re)-writing the Black Female Self, organized around essays, poetry, and short stories in Homegirls. Seeking to demystify the black lesbian subject in literature, I began the course with Jewelle Gomez’s essay “A Cultural Legacy Denied and Discovered: Black Lesbians in Fiction by Women.” Reclaiming the invisible lives of black lesbians in black women’s fiction, Gomez provided us with a literary history and tradition from which to begin theorizing new notions of womanhood:\n\nThe shadow of repression has concealed the Black Lesbian in literature in direct proportion to her invisibility in American society....
