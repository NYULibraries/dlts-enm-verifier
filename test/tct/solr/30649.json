Not only were they engaged in manufacture, they were also engaging in mimetic representation, albeit in words rather than images.”211 A similar point may be made about the way Chaucer, having become a romance miniaturist and materialist, approaches his literary art as a mechanical yet aesthetic undertaking. It is the issue of aesthetic creation he explored by way of a mechanical horse in Chaucer Squire’s Tale, as Ingham elucidates in her account of the “ambition of gadgets” in that romance.212 The poet has engineered a similar kind of problem in Sir Thopas, but by retooling romance as farce.\n        As a textual artifact, Chaucer’s Thopas shows him clearly engaging in playful reduction and destruction: the tale is a “tail-rhyme romance only in miniature” with oddly truncated stanzas.213 It is also broken off prematurely. Most important, Sir Thopas is himself a petite, doll-like creature inhabiting a dwindling fictional environment, and in a somewhat makeshift and malfunctioning manner. We get the sense that Chaucer is playing with this figment as he imagines a child would, not perfectly but with a relish for what can be made out of random things that are to hand. He is like Thopas himself, stopping the action for some “game and glee” in a narrative pursuit to slay a “geaunt with hevedes three [three heads].”214 Most notably, the knight has “sydes smale,” and they are made up to seem expressly artifactual and mechanical, as though Thopas were the sum of his moving parts and material props.215 When he rides on adventure, Sir Thopas encounters among the wild beasts the hardly terrifying “bukke and hare,” that is, deer and rabbits, and he goes not through any forbidding forest but what appears to be a backyard garden: “Ther spryngen herbes grete and smale.”216 And as Haskell observes, the knight’s complexion and beard are compared not so much to colored things as to coloring agents: “lyk scarlet in grayn” and “lyk saffoun” are references to dyestuffs.217 The knight’s painted-on appearance and meager frame feminize and infantilize him (as Chaucer had been in the prelude).218 By means of such conceits, Chaucer cuts the figure down to size, putting him safely beyond the reach of any dangerous romance eroticism.219 The knight’s libidinal energies are reduced to "},"document":{"title":"Becoming Human","author":"David Mitchell","publisher":"University of Minnesota Press","id":113,"isbn":"9780816689972"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":45499,"display_name":"Chaucer, Geoffrey -- The Squire's Tale"},"id":114407,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":45654,"display_name":"Haskell, Ann"},"id":115027,"ring_next":30650,"ring_prev":30648},{"basket":{"id":45695,"display_name":"Ingham, Patricia C."},"id":115180,"ring_next":30745,"ring_prev":30758},{"basket":{"id":45782,"display_name":"miniatures -- dolls, dollhouses and"},"id":115465,"ring_next":30652,"ring_prev":30644},{"basket":{"id":45988,"display_name":"toys, playthings and -- castoffs and makeshifts"},"id":116195,"ring_next":30538,"ring_prev":30627}],"localid":"page_109","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/ump-mitchell-0011.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"p109\" class=\"page\" />","css_selector":"#p109","xpath":"a[@id=\"p109\"]"},"next_location_id":30650,"previous_location_id":30648}]
