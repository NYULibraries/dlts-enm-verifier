One of the former depicts the star maidens who descend to earth in a wicker basket and dance to celestial music. A hunter triumphantly captures one of them, and while they remain together, she bears a son. But the fairy is not content with her life on earth: “her heart was filled with longing to revisit her native home” (this is Hartland’s homesick swan maiden).112 This narrative has been described as a reversal of the star husband tales “in which two [human] girls marry stars and successfully escape back to earth.”113 It is a story with many variations, but the basic synopsis provided by Stith Thompson is as follows:\nTwo girls are sleeping in the open at night and see two stars. They make wishes that they may be married to these stars. In the morning they find themselves in the upper world, each married to a star—one of them a young man and the other an old man. The women are usually warned against digging but eventually disobey and make a hole in the sky through which they see their old home below. They are seized with a longing to return and secure help in making a long rope. On this they eventually succeed in reaching home.114\nThe existence of both star wife and star husband tales suggests a keen awareness by the peoples who narrate them that the mortal wife of a demon lover and the swan maiden wife of a mortal man signify two sides of the same narrative coin. That the star girl trapped in the mortal world longs to return to the otherworld, whereas the human woman comes to long for the secure reality of her earthly existence, has to do with a virtually unresolvable oscillation between a pleasure and a reality principle.\nThe traditional swan maiden tale as well as familiar motifs from it are also narrated by the tribes who relate star girl and star husband stories.115 The story of “The Girl Who Married an Elk” portrays a young woman, who, upon discovering an inviting body of cool water, “determined to bathe, and … threw off her skirt and plunged in. While sporting in the water she noticed that a man had come and sat down on her skirt.” Because he possesses her clothing, she must go with him.116 A similar theme shows up in the Salish tale of how Crow Man appears "},"document":{"title":"In Search of the Swan Maiden","author":"Barbara Fass Leavy","publisher":"New York University Press","id":37,"isbn":"9780814751008"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":14381,"display_name":"Hartland, Edwin S."},"id":42147,"ring_next":8865,"ring_prev":8732},{"basket":{"id":14469,"display_name":"Monter, E.
