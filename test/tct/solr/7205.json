[{"id":7205,"content":{"content_unique_indicator":"33-page_100","content_descriptor":"page 100","text":"Matt Scott Crum (2014), a self-identified IC millennial, exemplified the tone of most of these expressions:\nIC has contributed an important part to the rising of a new generation of activists and leaders; people that were not loyal to just Invisible Children but awoke to a variety of types of injustices and became inspired and dedicated to do something about something. On my college campus alone, I can personally name a sizable group of students who altered their careers to be able to fight injustice in some way who got their start, their original passion, from Invisible Children’s content.\nAs if to confirm this sentiment, a core group of Fourth Estate alumni quickly launched “Fourth Estate—The Next Chapter,” a Facebook group dedicated to finding ways to harness IC’s youth energy into networked activities that would sustain the movement after IC shuts down. As the group continues to brainstorm next steps, it is also actively fundraising for IC’s final (and, by previous standards, modest) campaign to raise $150,000 to support its “most vital programs in the counter-LRA mission through 2015.” At the time of writing, it is unclear whether and how this fledgling participatory post-IC movement will evolve. But if the fact that they managed to meet and exceed their fundraising goal within a matter of days is an indicator of momentum, then we might be seeing interesting developments among IC supporters in the months to come.\nRegardless of whether a clearly defined post-IC youth movement emerges, the organization’s approach to mobilizing youth will likely live on as supporter and staff alumni continue to apply skills they acquired through IC to other contexts. We already see IC staff moving into positions at other nonprofits (like Giving Keys and To Write Love on Her Arms), corporate startups, and educational initiatives. We also see them applying IC’s approach to storytelling as a catalyst for social change to other causes. As these individuals continue to connect to each other through social media, we expect to see an increasingly more self-aware, loosely networked IC-inspired community of youth leaders take shape.\nIC’s decision in 2014 to prioritize its overseas goals over supporting its youth base—and its ultimate decision to let young supporters move on—distinguishes it from the groups in our other case studies, for whom youth engagement is central, not tangential, to their existence.
