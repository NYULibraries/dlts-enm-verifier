Further, the prosecution showed a surveillance video of Indelicato being congratulated at the Gambino family headquarters, the Ravenite Social Club, by Bonanno family consigliere Stefano Canone and Gambino family underboss Aniello Dellacroce less than half an hour after the murders. The government offered this after-the-fact approval to show that the commission had authorized Indelicato to kill Galante.\nThe Defense Case\nThe scope and depth of the prosecution case confronted the defendants with a difficult task.
