His solution is to create situations that permit disguised or justified aggression and innocent revenge, as he does for Antonio.\nThe play as a whole supports Antonio’s behavior. Because Shylock has refused to be merciful, Antonio and others can treat him with great cruelty at the end. Their vindictiveness is concealed by the fact that Shylock seems to have deserved his fate, that it is less severe than the law allows, and that it is being meted out in the name of mercy. Portia encourages Shylock’s insistence on his bond by giving him the impression that the law is on his side, and after she springs the trap, she refuses to allow him to relinquish his claim. According to the law, Shylock’s wealth is forfeit and his life is at the mercy of the Duke, but his life and half his wealth are spared when he accedes to Antonio’s demand that he convert to Christianity. He says he is “content” (4.1.392), but he leaves the stage a broken man: “I pray you give me leave to go from hence. / I am not well” (4.1.393–94). “If a Jew wrong a Christian,” Shylock had asked, “what is his humility? Revenge” (3.1.59–60). Despite Portia’s glorification of mercy and the appearance of generous treatment, the play bears out Shylock’s observation. Shakespeare’s rhetoric conceals this from us because, like his characters, he is at once celebrating self-effacing values and enjoying disguised and justified aggression.\n\n"},"document":{"title":"Imagined Human Beings","author":"Bernard J.
