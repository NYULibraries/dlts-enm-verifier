It did not attempt to abolish evil in its separate kingdom in the lower part of the tehiru. The sefirot were emanated, the worlds of the angels, the Throne of Glory, the celestial bodies, the heavens were all created, and then Man himself was created in the image of the Primordial Man. Man’s function was to reflect the dualism which ruled the cosmos as well as the Godhead. He included elements of good and evil together, a divine soul and a material body which struggled against each other. Man is a symbolic creature. The victories of the good in him represent victories of the good divine powers, whereas his sins represent victories of the evil powers. God entrusted the continuing struggle against evil to this symbolic creature. Its duty was to overcome the evil inside him, and in this way to bring forth the cosmic, mythic victory of good over evil. History from then onward is the story of Man’s attempts to fulfill this mythological role, for which he was created.\nThe basic difference between this second process of emanation and the traditional kabbalistic picture of the same process is, that when it developed, the Godhead was already in exile. Actually, It had been exiled twice before Man was created. First, when It willingly contracted into Itself, a process which can be described as God’s self-imposed exile from the “empty space” where creation was to proceed; second, when the vessels broke and the divine lights were driven back into the upper part of the divine world, while some divine sparks remained in the captivity of the emerging evil powers.
