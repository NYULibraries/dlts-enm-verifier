Soon after China was awarded the Games, Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC, said, “The IOC is not a political body—the IOC is a sports body. Having an influence on human rights issues is the task of political organisations and human rights organisations. It is not the task of the IOC to get involved in monitoring, or in lobbying or in policing” (BBC Sport 2001). And in 2006, Rogge's chief of staff wrote a letter to a protesting Tibetan group, the International Campaign for Tibet, rejecting the Tibetans' appeal that the IOC bring pressure to bear on China. Of course, the spokesperson said, a Beijing Olympics would play a positive role “in China's changing social and economic fabric,” but “We believe your demands fall unquestionably well outside the remit of our organization” (Hutzler 2006).\nThese expressions underscore the IOC's reluctance to respond to petitions and letters demanding action from a plethora of civil society groups and others. In contradistinction, the Olympics' capacity to promote positive political, economic, and social change is almost always an element of the bid award process. Before the Games were awarded, the IOC was less reluctant to tie the Games to China's human rights record: in April 2002, Rogge told BBC-TV, “We are convinced the Olympic Games will improve human rights in China … However, the IOC is a responsible organisation and if either security, logistics or human rights are not acted upon to our satisfaction, we will act” (Australian 2002). One might argue that the Olympic Bid is the occasion for setting forth competing narratives and that after the award, the role of the IOC is reduced, but this would be an odd reading of intentions. The conflict among these views undergirds the extraordinary global interest in what might be called “shaping China” from a variety of perspectives. Thus, it is important to look at the way the International Olympic Committee is being perceived, hectored, influenced, and pressured to alter its sense of mission and how this is done by countries, interest groups, and corporations within and outside China.\nCompeting Narratives, Civil Society and the Beijing Olympics\nWhat makes the 2008 Olympics different from these previous experiences is the increased complexity of issues and players involved in the\n"},"document":{"title":"Owning the Olympics: Narratives of the New China","author":"Price, Monroe E.; Dayan, Daniel","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":9,"isbn":"9780472024506"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1911,"display_name":"human rights"},"id":5490,"ring_next":1563,"ring_prev":1553},{"basket":{"id":1913,"display_name":"Human rights -- and IOC"},"id":5507,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1949,"display_name":"International Olympic Committee (IOC)"},"id":5536,"ring_next":1563,"ring_prev":1557},{"basket":{"id":1932,"display_name":"International Olympic Committee (IOC) -- and human rights"},"id":5588,"ring_next":1564,"ring_prev":1488},{"basket":{"id":2046,"display_name":"Rogge, Jacques"},"id":6000,"ring_next":1634,"ring_prev":1540},{"basket":{"id":2076,"display_name":"Tibet"},"id":6151,"ring_next":1563,"ring_prev":1515}],"localid":"page_96","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/10_chap03.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_96\">","css_selector":"#page_96","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_96\"]"},"next_location_id":1562,"previous_location_id":1560}]
