I was ordered to stand erect, facing the wall, all day long, and whoever passed by would hit me. My hands were chained behind my back, and they became all swollen and hurt a great deal.

All that week they didn’t give me any food, so he had pity on me and late one night brought me some baked goods with halvah from the marketplace. This food, however, made me terribly thirsty, and then it gave me diarrhea. I felt I was dehydrating. I remember standing there and feeling how my tongue was swelling in my mouth.

I didn’t feel it was terrible at the time, because this was my reality then and there: not to be caught sitting down and to find water when thirst was my punishment. Such deeds made me feel in control of my situation.\nSometimes they would punish me with starvation.
