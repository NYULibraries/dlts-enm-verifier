We shall support our army with our entire economic effort and with our entire capability. I have already declared that we have come into this war because of ideals, because the Hungarian people fight against Bolshevism with all their might. We must take part in this struggle with all our strength because this war will decide the fate of our nation—survival or cessation. And so once again I beg of you: starting today, starting now, please view this subject as the most central and most important problem of our country and of all our actions.\nAnother central topic in Kallay’s speech was the expropriation of the estates belonging to Jews:\nThe ministry of agriculture is involved in all kinds of problems, but with your permission, I will not deal with them at present…. I assume you read today in the official newspaper that all the estates of more than 500 hold belonging to Jews are, from today, in a state of deep freeze.

We shall expropriate all the lands in return for bonds, we shall not pay cash for the expropriated estates. The prime minister also mentioned the role of the minister of justice, “who will, in the most immediate future, present a bill for the expropriation of the estates of the Jews.”\nKallay also referred to Jewry in general:\nI shall not discuss the Jewish problem in order to clarify the question of whether Jewry is a race or not. I am of the opinion that we have already passed this stage, and that it has been clearly demonstrated that Jewry is indeed a race…. This is natural and self-explanatory, and I am unable to think of Jewry in any other terms than as a race.179\nThe first speaker after Kallay was the chairman of his party:\nHungarian policy has been based for the past decade on the idea of protecting the race, on the ideas of Christianity and nationalism known as “the Szeged idea.” ….
