For that matter, those critics who are engaged in “archival” work with the neglected writers of the past or “advocacy” work with the underread writers of the present have an important stake not merely in maintaining but in expanding literary study as literary study: neither such critics nor their client-authors will be well served by a disciplinary regime that jettisons “literature” as a spent vehicle no longer able to assist in cultural study’s further expansion.\nFor all his commercial success in 1994, Harold Bloom managed only to offer the claim that aesthetic contemplation of the beautiful is an end in itself; perhaps we theory-addled multiculturalists, we whom Bloom calls “displaced social workers,” can do better. At the very least, we should not allow Bloom’s solipsistic defense of the field to stand as the only one in public view. Whenever we are castigated as politicos and philistines intruding on the purity of the aesthetic experience, we need to remind our accusers that—as one theorist once put it—literature not only delights but instructs, at least every once in a while. It is a shame that arguments such as these are now more prevalent among cultural reactionaries, embittered aesthetes, and right-wing flacks than among the leading figures in departments of English; reactionaries and flacks have done much to make these arguments suspect, and Bloom himself has done more than anyone to discredit the idea that value judgments in the field of English can be something other than expressions of idiosyncratic predilections.\nAs for my own predilections, I can say that whenever I read a professional reactionary like Robert Brustein maligning the “victim art” of choreographer Bill T. Jones on the grounds “that reality without artistic transcendence turns us all into voyeurs, that the visionary gleam rather than any narcissistic glitter is what redeems American art” (10), I want to run screaming from any discussion of “aesthetics” or “transcendence.” But we should not let the hypocrisy of flacks or the arrogance of Blooms deter us from making the case for the value of literary study and the "},"document":{"title":"The Employment of English","author":"Michael Bérubé","publisher":"New York University Press","id":40,"isbn":"9780814713013"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":14852,"display_name":"Bloom, Harold -- and value of literary studies"},"id":43304,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":14855,"display_name":"Brustein, Robert"},"id":43312,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":14959,"display_name":"English departments -- reactionaries in"},"id":43456,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":14983,"display_name":"Faculty -- reactionary"},"id":43488,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":15137,"display_name":"Literary study -- value of"},"id":43739,"ring_next":9804,"ring_prev":9741}],"localid":"page_109","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch04.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_109\">","css_selector":"#page_109","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_109\"]"},"next_location_id":9768,"previous_location_id":9766}]
