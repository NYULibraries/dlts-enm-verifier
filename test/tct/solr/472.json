EVE Online is Iceland's other hi-tech progeny: a critically lauded online world with its own full-time economist and a 200,000-strong population of gamers. Like Iceland itself, the game is an acquired taste and the preferred destination for a limited number of travelers. It, too, is bleakly beautiful and as technologically sophisticated as it is forbidding and cruel. It is a game that could only have been made here in this mid-Atlantic bubble, where certain rules do not seem to apply. It was a debut project that seemed completely uncowed by the considerable risks it was taking. CCP, the company behind EVE, was unrelenting in the face of commercial pressures, they were also, like the Vikings, pioneering and perhaps even foolhardy. This game has been hugely controversial and has attracted a peculiar kind of commitment from its players—of which I am one particularly troubled example. I love this game, and I loathe it.\nMy first glimpse of EVE happened after a magazine editor dismissed it as doomed. It was something that either would never be commercially released or would disappear into the gaming churn without a trace within a few months, just another overly optimistic project lost to bad luck and bad marketing—or so the editor predicted. But instead of vanishing, it consolidated, grew, expanded, and inspired. Reykjavik's hi-tech baby had obsessed me for five years. Arriving at its home gave me a sense of energy that was inaccessible elsewhere. I was heading toward the source of a gaming project that had consumed a significant portion of my life.\n"},"document":{"title":"This Gaming Life","author":"Rossignol, Jim","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":2,"isbn":"9780472023141"},"context":null,"occurrences":[],"localid":"page_118","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap05.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_118\">","css_selector":"#page_118","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_118\"]"},"next_location_id":473,"previous_location_id":471}]
