These two idealists and civil rights martyrs were killed by white racists along with their Black companion, James Earl Chaney, in the summer of 1964 in Mississippi. It is reasonable to assume that Goodman was influenced more by his Communist background than by his Jewish background. Goodman’s parents were sympathizers who often held fundraisers in the 1950s in their Manhattan apartment for professors accused of Communist ties. The convicted Communist spy Alger Hiss was a visitor to the Goodman home. Schwerner identified himself as an atheist who believed in the infinite perfectibility of men. Deciding at age thirteen not to become a bar mitzvah, he later declared that he was not Jewish but rather “only” a man.67 There seems to have been an interesting generational dynamic going on among the Jews of the left which would become far more pronounced with the radicalization of the youth movement in the late 1960s. Whereas the promise of universal equality had made leftism in all its varieties appealing to earlier generations of young Jews marked with the indelible etchings of the Jewish ghetto, later generations of young Jews seemed to have absorbed much of the older generation’s universalism but little of the Jewish ghetto. It seems more accurate to say that those Jewish youth who found meaning only in civil rights activism had not been running away from a static or “irrelevant” Judaism but in fact had never really been affected by any meaningful Jewish experience. As the journalist Jack Newfield put it, the young alienated Jews were “the children of economic surplus and spiritual starvation who sought to give meaning to their lives by identifying them with a cause greater than their own personal needs.”68\nThe reaction of Jewish race militants to the issue of rising Black anti-Semitism revealed that, in some cases, their commitment to radical racial change transcended even the most rudimentary concerns about basic communal defense and safety. The most conspicuous instance of Black anti-Semitism was the growing popularity of the Black nationalist Nation of Islam. The seething poverty of most Black slums made the nationalist philosophy of the Black Muslims appealing. The Nation of Islam, which derived much of its philosophy from Marcus Garvey and the Moorish Temple Movement of Noble Drew Ali of the 1920s and 1930s, preached Black supremacy, racial segregation, social uplift, and economic self-reliance. The philosophy of the group, led by “Messenger of Allah” Elijah Muhammad and his second-in-command, Malcolm X, taught that Blacks were God’s original creation and that “out of the weak of the Black Nation, the present Caucasian race was created.” The central myth of the Black Muslims involves "},"document":{"title":"Blacks in the Jewish Mind","author":"Seth Forman","publisher":"New York University Press","id":83,"isbn":"9780814726815"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":33837,"display_name":"Ali, Noble Drew"},"id":84947,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":33845,"display_name":"Anti-Semitism -- Black"},"id":84996,"ring_next":22757,"ring_prev":22619},{"basket":{"id":33890,"display_name":"Black Muslims"},"id":85082,"ring_next":22692,"ring_prev":22800},{"basket":{"id":33891,"display_name":"nationalism -- Black"},"id":85090,"ring_next":22701,"ring_prev":22650},{"basket":{"id":33933,"display_name":"Chaney, James Earl"},"id":85161,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":34035,"display_name":"Garvey, Marcus"},"id":85353,"ring_next":22699,"ring_prev":22634},{"basket":{"id":34086,"display_name":"Hiss, Alger"},"id":85452,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":34233,"display_name":"Moorish Temple Movement"},"id":85709,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":34239,"display_name":"Muhammad, Elijah"},"id":85719,"ring_next":22689,"ring_prev":22689},{"basket":{"id":31419,"display_name":"Islam, Nation of"},"id":85754,"ring_next":24301,"ring_prev":20581},{"basket":{"id":34257,"display_name":"Newfield, Jack"},"id":85770,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":34358,"display_name":"Schwerner, Michael"},"id":85947,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":3739,"display_name":"X, Malcolm"},"id":86093,"ring_next":22756,"ring_prev":20314}],"localid":"page_70","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch02.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_70\">","css_selector":"#page_70","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_70\"]"},"next_location_id":22689,"previous_location_id":22687}]
