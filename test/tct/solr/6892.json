It certainly has prevented many blog owners who have open comment areas from inadvertently adding to spam pollution. But even if some link spammers have been discouraged, more than enough remain undeterred so that the problem of spammers is still overwhelming. While many blogs have automatically implemented the nofollow attribute on all links in their public areas, a large number of spammers will apparently spam anywayâ€”finding it more efficient to be indiscriminate, perhaps, or in hopes of benefiting somehow in any case.\nBusinesses That Mine Data for Popularity: Not a Model for Civil Society\nFrom a political standpoint, one might hope that the use of the nofollow attribute regarding hate sites would lower their rankings as people who mention them unfavorably discourage linking. But the use of this attribute in linking requires both knowledge of its existence and some sophisticated knowledge of how to code a link (as opposed to using a simple interface). So while this way of separating meanings is helpful overall, it is complicated enough to carry out so that the problem is not substantially addressed in practice.\nMoving from the specifics of the nofollow attribute to the more general impact of links on people's consciousness, it should be clear by now that Google-like approaches to searching, which base rankings on the popularity of links, tend not to question the society's basic hierarchy. One initial simplistic way of thinking about link networks is to somehow lump all nodes together, as if there were no other structure for determining who received links. But since many links are made by people, all the prejudices and biases that affect who someone networks with personally or professionally can affect who they network with in terms of hypertext linkage.
