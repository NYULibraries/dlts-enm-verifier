Are the “extra moisturizers” in Barbasol Pure Silk shaving cream for women worth the 342 percent price differential over the men’s version?53 Do personal care items necessarily have a gender?\nBeyond clothes, books, and toys, pay attention to the continual bombardment of gender-coded images amid all the paraphernalia of childhood. Susan Hoy Crawford, in Beyond Dolls and Guns: 101 Ways to Help Children Avoid Gender Bias, offers suggestions on ways to recognize sexism in children’s lives, such as “the racism test” (substituting race for sex in a situation—parents might overlook a little boy’s comment “I hate girls,” but would respond if a racial term were used) or “the workplace test” (a classroom sheet of telephones and addresses with boys and girls listed in separate columns might not cause a stir at home, but would if it were handed out in an employment setting).\nIt is normal human behavior to latch onto colloquial expressions. But some expressions carry a huge amount of cultural baggage. Gender stereo-types and role expectations compress into little verbal packages such as “He’s all boy!” or “Boys will be boys” or “Isn’t she sweet” (or “cute” or “pretty”). They assume that gender is the primary identifier. They also assume that certain characteristics of a gender are a given. The challenge is to replace those naturalistic and gendered linguistic markers with words reflecting more desirable character traits—such as cooperative, critical, and socially contributory—that we want all children to have.\nEven those of us who approach gender with the best of egalitarian intentions can unthinkingly reinforce traditional expectations and roles. I offer as just one anecdotal example a conversation I had with my husband when our second child was just under a year old. Seven years before, Tim had taken a year off from practicing law and stayed home as the primary caregiver for the first year with our son, Aaron. Under our familial version of an equal time arrangement, I took primary responsibility for the second child during infancy. Our daughter, Dylan, came to work with me for the first six months of her life. One evening when Dylan was a few months old I was heading to bed early and asked Tim if he would do the final diaper change of the night. “She’ll probably need you to put on socks and a sweater; it may get cold tonight,” I said. “Will do,” Tim said. “Oh, and don’t forget to put the crib side up,” I said on the way out of the room. (He had, after all, left it down once.) “Shall I also take the scorpions out of her crib?” Tim asked politely.\n"},"document":{"title":"The Gender Line","author":"Nancy Levit","publisher":"New York University Press","id":76,"isbn":"9780814751213"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":26139,"display_name":"Child care"},"id":78405,"ring_next":11403,"ring_prev":20634},{"basket":{"id":31219,"display_name":"Crawford, Susan Hoy"},"id":78431,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":31295,"display_name":"Gender -- based pricing"},"id":78603,"ring_next":20510,"ring_prev":20510},{"basket":{"id":24921,"display_name":"Languages"},"id":78696,"ring_next":21676,"ring_prev":20462}],"localid":"page_245","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch08.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_245\">","css_selector":"#page_245","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_245\"]"},"next_location_id":20654,"previous_location_id":20652}]
