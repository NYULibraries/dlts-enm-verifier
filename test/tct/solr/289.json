Civilization models religious influence in a specific manner (civilizations with the same religion tend to be allies) so the debate concerning Orthodox or Catholic Christianity in Georgia was significant not just for historical accuracy, but also for gameplay. The debate over content forced a debate over the computer code, and a resulting alteration, which spurred further discussion. The act of creation and exchange was not unlike that which occurs in a university seminar. Instead of writing a historiographical paper using the publications of historians, “Holyone” created a mod drawing on the game Civilization IV. Instead of presenting it to a class, and engaging in a debate with his colleagues, he published it to the web, where his peers could respond, with passionate arguments, expressed in misspellings, emoticons, and other signifiers of the Internet age. “Drtad” was a significant player in this meta-game, and not just because he had taken the name of the king of the first country to adopt Christianity. As a result of his comments, and those of the rest of the community, “Holyone” modified and enhanced his scenario, resulting in a more persuasive product of historical play.\nThis kind of peer review is not unusual. In “The Rise and Fall of Rome,” another Civfanatics discussion, amateur historians, not historians or classic students, developed a historically “authentic” simulation of Roman culture. They explored the conditions behind the emergence of the Social War (the war between Rome and its Italian allies, or socii, during the early first century B.C.E.), and devised a way to allow for the possibility of the war to emerge out of gameplay.\nThese examples from the meta-game surrounding Civilization IV demonstrate how we envision teaching through gaming. As we showed in the first part of the chapter, the game itself becomes not a teaching tool, but rather a kind of artifact that we study to determine its procedural rhetoric, which we then deconstruct in the tradition of historiography. Students can then build on this analysis, as we show immediately above, and through modding and the meta-game, create their own representations of history.\nBuilding a Game ex novo, and the Meta-Game\nIf historians understand computer code as another language through which to express historical thinking, we can move beyond tweaking the algorithms of an established game such as Civilization. Taken to its logical conclusion, the ultimate meta-game is the construction of a game ex novo, in which code is used to develop an original artifact. In the same way that students write a research paper, investigating primary and secondary sources and then "},"document":{"title":"Pastplay: Teaching and Learning History with Technology","author":"Kee, Kevin","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press","id":1,"isbn":"9780472120482"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":5,"display_name":"algorithms -- in games"},"id":9,"ring_next":101,"ring_prev":282},{"basket":{"id":7,"display_name":"amateur historians"},"id":18,"ring_next":330,"ring_prev":287},{"basket":{"id":38,"display_name":"Civilization"},"id":168,"ring_next":291,"ring_prev":282},{"basket":{"id":49,"display_name":"computer code -- arguments expressed in"},"id":203,"ring_next":293,"ring_prev":283},{"basket":{"id":133,"display_name":"modding, as learning experience -- classroom case study of"},"id":483,"ring_next":96,"ring_prev":96},{"basket":{"id":171,"display_name":"representations, of history"},"id":616,"ring_next":293,"ring_prev":286}],"localid":"page_281","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter13.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_281\">","css_selector":"#page_281","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_281\"]"},"next_location_id":290,"previous_location_id":288}]
