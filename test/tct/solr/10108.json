Barron links the influence of the witches as evil mother figures with that of Lady Macbeth on her husband-son, shows that the witch-mother is not only treacherous but treacherous in the feeding situation, sees the bearded weird sisters and the “unsexed” Lady Macbeth as domineering, masculine women who instill their own “vaulting ambition” into the husband-son, and argues that Macbeth has qualms about his masculinity because he submits to the maternal authority of the witches and Lady Macbeth rather than to the paternal authority of Duncan.\nAs I read it now, the fundamental strength of Barron’s interpretation stems from its person-oriented object-relational features, such as when he observes that Macbeth progressively tries to cut himself off from his wife’s influence (first murdering Duncan at her instigation, then murdering Banquo after giving her no more than a hint, and finally killing Macduff’s wife and children without prior communication), so that by the end of the play her death elicits no more than a remark that “she should have died hereafter.” The main weakness of Barron’s interpretation derives from its Freudian posture with respect to sexuality, especially orality. The tide of his paper, “The Babe that Milks” (alluding to Lady Macbeth’s “I have given suck, and know/How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me”) reflects this emphasis. In contrast, I would now contend that the many oral images in the text of the play should be read broadly, as analogical metaphors encoding relationships, rather than narrowly, as signs that characterize the nature of these relationships in a literal way. I would say the same thing about the innumerable phallic images of the play that once seemed so sexually significant; they now appear more meaningful for the way in which they define Macbeth’s intrapersonal failure to identify with the oedipal father except in a manner that incorporates the pre-oedipal mother’s subversive, ruthless dictates. And whereas I formerly construed Macbeth’s anxiety in the Freudian, mainly oedipal context of castration anxiety, as Barron does in part, I would now emphasize early interactional sources of anxiety, as Barron also does, though he tends to see the problem to a considerable extent in terms of oral deprivation.\nThe extent to which Macbeth exhibits anxiety can scarcely be overstated. Though fearless in battle prior to seeing the witches, Macbeth becomes anxious almost immediately afterward when he thinks about killing the king:\n\n                      Why do I yield to that suggestionWhose horrid image doth unfix my hair"},"document":{"title":"Self and Other","author":"Robert Rogers","publisher":"New york University Press","id":41,"isbn":"9780814774434"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":12577,"display_name":"anxiety"},"id":44072,"ring_next":18094,"ring_prev":10055},{"basket":{"id":15481,"display_name":"Interactional anxiety"},"id":44308,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":15550,"display_name":"Orality and object relations"},"id":44438,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_172","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/ch08.html","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_172\">","css_selector":"#page_172","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_172\"]"},"next_location_id":10109,"previous_location_id":10107}]
