In many ways, this strategy echoes the statement that appears in the Mountain Brothers’ publicity packet in which group members, primarily Chinese Americans, express their “dedication to the art”:\n\nBecause of [the Mountain Brother’s] dedication to the art, they (like the originators and true keepers of hip-hop) bring the kind of material that will add to hip-hop music, not steal from it or cheapen it. No shallow gimmicks, no karate kicks, no horror movie blood splattering, no “songs that sound like the group that went platinum,” just straight up self truth. What the Mountain Brothers represent most of all is a deep love, respect, and ability for true “rewind the shit over and over in your walkman” hip-hop.9\n\nSeveral of the DJs I interviewed likewise emphasize their “love” and “respect” for the culture and commitment to what they perceive as the true essence of hip-hop.\n\nSOUP-A-CRUNK: I think it does matter. I think it’s a good thing mainly because it’s a part of hip-hop and we have a firm hold on it. But really, Filipinos represent in all aspects. It’s a matter of recognition. I mean, it’s not like we’re looking for recognition, ’cause we’re gonna be in it whether or not we do. It’s just that we’re in it because we love it. I think it’s important because it shows how diverse it is, how hip-hop is, and it represents—how it is for the people.10\n\nIn Soup-a-Crunk’s view, it is this emotional attachment to and investment in hip-hop that not only legitimizes Filipino participation in hip-hop but also makes it possible to transcend racial difference. Their “dedication to the art” allows Filipinos to align themselves with “the originators and true keepers of hip-hop,” affording them cultural authenticity.\nIn this context, the notion of “represent” means a commitment to preserving the integrity of hip-hop and elevating the culture, which takes on added significance given the corporate takeover of hip-hop and subsequent pronouncements of its demise. Soup-a-Crunk relies on what Shuhei Hosokawa describes in another context as “rhetoric of an affective connection that makes the particular appeal of a musical style universally relevant.”11 This rhetoric usually takes the form of “respect” and “passion” (or in Soup-a-Crunk’s case, “love”) for the culture, which has the effect of universalizing hip-hop. In other words, assertions of belongingness are made on the basis of affective claims that allow anyone to establish cultural legitimacy and become part of a broader community that transcends history, geography, culture, and race. In effect, affective grounds for claiming hip-hop trumps the location of Filipino youth outside the foundational narrative of hip-hop.\n"},"document":{"title":"FILIPINOS REPRESENT","author":"Antonio T.
