Maybrick claimed not only that she used arsenic as a complexion aid, but that her husband James used it “as a tonic—it was considered a sexual stimulant,” which accounted for the presence of the poison in his body. She testified that he had asked her to give him arsenic (Knelman 118).\n26. The Forster Act of 1870 established universal public education in Britain.\nCHAPTER THREE\n1. For exemplary work in the field of early film studies, see Elsaesser and Barker's volume, which focuses on formal analysis of early film, or Charney and Schwartz's volume, which focuses on cultural and historical analysis.\n2. Daly and Sanders have recently interwoven analysis of turn-of-the-century British literature and film, Daly focusing on Boer War films and Kipling's “Mrs Bathurst” and Sanders focusing on the figure of the shopgirl.\n3. Hansen considers early U.S. cinema in relation to Habermas's theories of the public sphere and Negt and Kluge's theories of the “proletarian public sphere.” Hiley, establishing that the early British film audience was demonstrably working class at least until World War I, follows Hansen in arguing that “the British cinema auditorium was indeed a proletarian public sphere, in which the context of performance was determined by the interplay between its working class audience and the screened image. Much of the meaning of a film was indeed created within the auditorium, not simply by the accompanying music and sound effects, but more importantly by the reaction of the audience” (“British Cinema” 164). This audience “encouraged a communal style of performance. There was a great deal of talking” (162), contradicting “middle class virtues of individual spectatorship and concentrated attention” that many filmmakers would soon work to inculcate (166).\n4. For British filmmakers' response to this state of affairs, see Furniss (“Where Are the English Films?” or “English—By the Americans”), or a 1909 interview with George Howard Cricks, who opined: “At the present time the English output of film pictures is certainly not more than one tenth of the world's production. Well, British industry is not going to take that sitting down…. the English people in the long run prefer British sentiment and feeling in the pictures they pay to see in our theatres” (“The Future” 12).\n5. See The Bioscope, 16 June 1910, 11, and The Film Censor, 26 June 1912, 2.\n6. Due to the relative paucity of its output, critics have paid less attention to the early British industry than, for example, the U.S. film industry. Most work in this area has aimed to uncover a national cinematic tradition: see the first two volumes of Low's venerable history of British film as well as Barnes, Murphy, and Burton and Porter. Chanan takes a different approach in his fascinating Marxian-materialist study.\n7. This film is held in the National Film Archive (NFA) at the British Film Institute (BFI) on the “Biograph Compilation #5” reel. The NFA catalog identifies the film as a scene from a longer film, no longer extant, called Women and Wine. Duel to the Death is listed in the third edition of Gifford's catalog of British film (an index of every film ever known to have been made in Britain). Most films discussed in this chapter, unless otherwise indicated, were viewed at the British Film Institute, but some exist in multiple locations.
