Thus a 1926 piece on blood pressure in the American Magazine argued that even love could damage the system, as opposed to a calmer, cheerful but more controlled approach to romance.71\nBoth religious and secular authorities found support for their claims in the growing belief in the need for emotional control. Serene faith might be a remedy, “allowing our bodies to recover from many ills.” John Watson argued in Harper’s that the same result would be achieved by a scientifically sound childrearing strategy that would prevent durable disruption of the nervous and digestive systems by teaching children how to avoid strong emotion, enabling them to “get a grip” on their own emotional behavior. In Harper’s in 1922, a Harvard medical school professor chimed in with a cautionary essay on “What Strong Emotions Do to Us.” After detailing all the standard circulatory, digestive, and cardiac issues, Dr. Cannon turned to the proper preventatives: solid rational control. “The wise man” is he who accepts problems “philosophically, and so far as possible, turns his attention to other affairs. Thus the futile emotional disturbance may be aborted.” A proper mental attitude can allow “emotional factors” to be “diverted and minimized to insignificance.”72\nThe early decades of the twentieth century thus saw what one historian has termed the “somaticization” of psychological tensions. Another historian, more vaguely but quite accurately, speaks of a transition from fears of forces in the outer world, which were dominant in Western culture through the eighteenth century, to fears of inner forces, which gained ground during the twentieth century.73 The growing anxieties about emotion that developed during the initial phases of the shift away from Victorian emotionology expressed both the somaticization process and the heightened concern about unseen but menacing currents in the body’s interior. A new nervousness about health, all the greater for uncertainties about the afterlife, helped regulate emotional norms as shifts in emotionology participated in other fundamental changes in middle-class beliefs.
