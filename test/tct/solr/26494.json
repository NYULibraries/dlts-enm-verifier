He briefly served as a professor at the law school until he became a judge on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. He eventually took a seat on the United States Supreme Court and remained active on that bench into his nineties. See, e.g., BERNARD SCHWARTZ, MAIN CURRENTS IN AMERICAN LEGAL THOUGHT 376–96 (Durham, N.C.: Carolina Academic Press 1993). Holmes was a deeply skeptical but practical man. Gilmore said that Holmes “was savage, harsh, and cruel, a bitter and lifelong pessimist who saw in the course of human life nothing but a continuing struggle in which the rich and powerful impose their will on the poor and weak.” GILMORE, THE AGES OF AMERICAN LAW, supra at 49. The “real Holmes” may never be known, since he was an intensely private and enigmatic person. One fact is certain, however: Holmes’s complex thought established a second path for the development of modern jurisprudence. See G. EDWARD WHITE, JUSTICE OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES: LAW AND THE INNER SELF (New York: Oxford University Press 1993); Morton J. Horwitz, The Place of Justice Holmes in American Legal Thought, in THE LEGACY OF OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, JR. (R. W. Gordon, ed.) (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press 1992).\n28. GILMORE, THE AGES OF AMERICAN LAW, supra at 48.\n29. See OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, THE COMMON LAW (Boston: Little, Brown & Co. 1881). The success of these lectures earned Holmes an appointment at Harvard Law School as a professor of law. Holmes’s position at Harvard Law School lasted only three months after being appointed to the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, where he served until his appointment to the United States Supreme Court in 1902. See ROBERT STEVENS, LAW SCHOOLS: LEGAL EDUCATION IN AMERICA from the 1850s to the 1980s 138 (Chapel Hill: Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1983).\n30. See Grey, Holmes and Legal Pragmatism, supra at 795. It is generally recognized that Holmes was influenced by the American pragmatist philosophy of Charles Sanders Peirce and John Dewey. Id. at 788. Holmes’s views were pragmatic in spirit, but his philosophy was not the same as that of Pierce’s or Dewey’s. See Gary Minda, One Hundred Years of Modern Legal Thought: From Langdell and Holmes to Posner and Schlag, forthcoming in INDIANA LAW REVIEW.\n31. HOLMES, THE COMMON LAW, supra at 5.\n32.
