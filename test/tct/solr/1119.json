As a 37-year-old French man explained, “My first film [at the movie theater] was Superman and I also saw Tron. . . . Tron, that was phenomenal! I will be marked by Tron for my entire life, I never found an equivalent.” Or, as the 77-year-old Japanese woman quoted above offered in a different interview: “They showed Casablanca on TV four or five days ago and I watched it. . . . I watched that movie when I was young and I loved it, I was very glad to be able to see it again. I loved those movies and still love them.” Even younger informants felt that U.S. texts had a lasting impact on their media consumption. As a 23-year-old Japanese woman explained, “When we were little, we listened to Western music, watched Popeye or Tom and Jerry, these kinds of things. At that time, I didn’t understand English, but somehow we were moved by these programs. They were so impressive that we can remember them even now.”\nYet, if Japanese and French media consumers’ recollections of getting up in the morning to watch Looney Tunes or of enjoying Disney films were often quite similar in tone to those of the U.S. consumers I interviewed (and for whom these texts were not “global” but “culturally native”)—as a 40-year-old U.S. informant put it, not mentioning the Warner Brothers would be like “leaving an element off the periodic chart”—this book has demonstrated that these experiences must be interpreted with caution. Most importantly we must resist the impulse to equate the (omni)presence of U.S. texts with a kind of cultural imperialism à la Dorfman and Mattelart (1971) generating visions of non-U.S. consumers abandoning their baguettes or onigiri (Japanese rice balls) to run to the nearest McDonald after watching the latest episode of Desperate Housewives.\nFirst of all, because the United States still holds a relative economic advantage in terms of its production budgets—think of the average cost of a Hollywood movie compared to a French or Japanese film1—these texts were frequently appreciated for the overall technical quality of their production, regardless of the value of their textual content. Both French and Japanese media consumers frequently commented on the “larger scale” and the higher production value—as one Japanese informant put it, “If you have a lot of money you can do these kinds of things”—of U.S. fare. Thus, Avatar was praised as a visually stunning work employing innovative production techniques (that no one outside Hollywood could ever afford to use) despite the fact that its narrative was often read as a disappointing rehashing of the too-familiar Hollywood tale of the white (North American) man saving the non-white feminized natives.\n"},"document":{"title":"Imagining the Global: Transnational Media and Popular Culture Beyond East and West","author":"Darling-Wolf, Fabienne","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","id":6,"isbn":"9780472120796"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":1027,"display_name":"American cartoons"},"id":3005,"ring_next":1122,"ring_prev":1118},{"basket":{"id":1039,"display_name":"Cameron, James, Avatar"},"id":3039,"ring_next":1154,"ring_prev":1117},{"basket":{"id":1090,"display_name":"Casablanca"},"id":3161,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1114,"display_name":"Imperialism -- cultural"},"id":3236,"ring_next":1124,"ring_prev":1113},{"basket":{"id":1124,"display_name":"Desperate Housewives"},"id":3251,"ring_next":1097,"ring_prev":1118},{"basket":{"id":1130,"display_name":"Disney productions"},"id":3273,"ring_next":1122,"ring_prev":1118},{"basket":{"id":1133,"display_name":"Dorfman, Ariel"},"id":3281,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1215,"display_name":"Gone with the Wind"},"id":3540,"ring_next":3783,"ring_prev":3943},{"basket":{"id":1243,"display_name":"Hollywood productions"},"id":3640,"ring_next":1123,"ring_prev":1108},{"basket":{"id":1259,"display_name":"Indiana Jones series"},"id":3717,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1280,"display_name":"Japan -- relationship to U.S."},"id":3811,"ring_next":1123,"ring_prev":1095},{"basket":{"id":1348,"display_name":"Mattelart, Armand"},"id":3997,"ring_next":1155,"ring_prev":1155},{"basket":{"id":1419,"display_name":"Planet of the Apes"},"id":4215,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1451,"display_name":"Roman Holiday"},"id":4307,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":1501,"display_name":"Star Wars series"},"id":4432,"ring_next":1127,"ring_prev":1106},{"basket":{"id":1510,"display_name":"Superman"},"id":4450,"ring_next":7117,"ring_prev":27961},{"basket":{"id":1533,"display_name":"Tron"},"id":4522,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null}],"localid":"page_128","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chapter06.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_128\">","css_selector":"#page_128","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_128\"]"},"next_location_id":1120,"previous_location_id":1118}]
