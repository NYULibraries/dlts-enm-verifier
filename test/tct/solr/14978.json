He writes, “Be thankful! You became famous and got to America for free, and all this because you were a German Jew without a birth certificate—you are to be envied!” Much of the article is a condemnation of Germany and its unfair laws that cause it to expel its own people. It ends, “I have cried enough in you, therefore I will not cry over you. … I want to forget you like you forgot me. You have your work … till you become a land where they don’t ask about religion, estate, place of birth and birth certificate. … Just as I am going to a land where they don’t ask anything more than ‘are you a human being?’”14\nFifteen years later, when the position of Jews in Germany had improved greatly, Philippson linked conditions in Germany and emigration, in a totally different way. In 1860 he condemned calls for mass emigration, saying that the improvement in the political situation of German Jews that had taken place would have been impossible if they had emigrated. “No, the destiny of our race seems to be a different one.
