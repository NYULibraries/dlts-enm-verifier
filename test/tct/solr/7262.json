At times, they also mobilize these networks to achieve civic goals.\n“Precarious publics” may be the right theoretical frame in which to understand this emergent American Muslim movement. We defined a precarious public as “one where there is a considerable gap between voice and influence.” In such circumstances, youth have to weigh the perceived benefits of participation against the obstacles and possible risks. Our notion of precariousness owes much to Mary Gray’s (2009) research on queer and LGBT youth in rural America. Gray harnesses Jurgen Habermas’s seminal theorization of the “bourgeois public sphere” as an autonomous space where public opinion can be formed. She also incorporates feminist scholarly critiques of a universalized public sphere. In particular, Gray builds on Nancy Fraser and Michael Warner, who pointedly demonstrated that Habermas’s conceptualization overlooked the existence of multiple (counter)publics that have been and will continue to be sites of contention that blur boundaries between what is private and what is public. Extending those critiques, she proposes the notion of “boundary publics,” which she defines as “iterative, ephemeral experiences of belonging that circulate across the outskirts and through the center(s) of a more recognized and validated public sphere” (92–93). Through her ethnography of the Highlight Pride Alliance (another HPA), Gray argues “boundary publics” reveal “a complex web of relations that is always playing out the politics and negotiations of identity” (93). As such, they are “at once within and just beyond the reach of conservative elites attempts to” claim control.\nBoundary publics, according to Gray, manifest both in everyday face-to-face and online spaces. She recounts the HPA youth “performing drag” in the Springhaven, Kentucky, Walmart, the only business that stays “open 24 hours within an 80-mile radius,” as a “rite of passage for those entering the local gay scene” (97). At the same time, she describes an incident at the Walmart where the youth were slandered by a hostile and verbally aggressive peer to the point that they had to leave the store. The rural youth described in Gray’s study encountered analogous “opportunities and challenges” online. She finds the internet gave them access to experiences unavailable “in their daily life,” but it also brought “risk of exposure” (127–130). As a consequence, they found themselves "},"document":{"title":"By Any Media Necessary","author":"Henry Jenkins et al","publisher":"New York University Press","id":33,"isbn":"9781479899982"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":10254,"display_name":"Frazier, Nancy"},"id":32733,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":10274,"display_name":"Gray, Mary"},"id":32778,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":9678,"display_name":"Habermas, Jurgen"},"id":32798,"ring_next":7733,"ring_prev":7060},{"basket":{"id":10321,"display_name":"Highland Pride Alliance"},"id":32880,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":10358,"display_name":"Influence"},"id":32956,"ring_next":8363,"ring_prev":8363},{"basket":{"id":10580,"display_name":"Precarious publics"},"id":33522,"ring_next":7288,"ring_prev":7255},{"basket":{"id":10588,"display_name":"Public (the)"},"id":33538,"ring_next":8172,"ring_prev":8534},{"basket":{"id":10589,"display_name":"Publics -- boundary publics"},"id":33539,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":4993,"display_name":"voice"},"id":33888,"ring_next":21022,"ring_prev":7187},{"basket":{"id":8556,"display_name":"Wal-Mart"},"id":33894,"ring_next":6440,"ring_prev":7219},{"basket":{"id":7997,"display_name":"Warner, Michael"},"id":33896,"ring_next":5987,"ring_prev":5988}],"localid":"page_157","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chapter4.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pg_157\" title=\"157\">","css_selector":"#pg_157","xpath":"span[@id=\"pg_157\"]"},"next_location_id":7263,"previous_location_id":7261}]
