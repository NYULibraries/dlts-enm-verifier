Sutter and Pamela Street. Whitehead apparently concludes that the only way to free oneself from the history of racism is to alienate or abandon stultifying cultural traditions or narratives. The artwork of Michael Ray Charles has adopted a much more controversial style by reworking established trademarks (even though he uses copyright symbols liberally in his work, like and/or in homage to Jean-Michel Basquiat). Ignoring the subtle legal distinctions between copyright and trademark, Charles promotes his own version of “fair use” of racist caricatures in order to liberate himself from their power. No less than Whitehead, Charles illustrates how intellectual property law, especially trademark law, has created raced property interests that operate through racist stereotypes and that have effected the transfer of ownership rights of the American cultural imagination to white people and the corporations they own.95\nDrawing on advertisements from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Charles has created scores of paintings that illuminate the racial fictions that structure popular culture's imagery. Central to his critical project is the ongoing deconstruction of unconsciously (and sometimes consciously) raced trademarks and trademarked styles. Everything from the Pillsbury Dough Boy and Aunt Jemima to Wonder Woman and Clorox Bleach has become subject to Charles's critical eye. Charles even reworks images that have become trademark signatures of other artists, such as Grant Wood's American Gothic and Norman Rockwell's Saturday Evening Post imagery. In working with and through popular-culture icons and trademarks, Michael Ray Charles draws on strategies developed by earlier African American artists, especially their use of Aunt Jemima. As Michael Harris ably demonstrates by collecting dozens of artworks including and/or commenting on Aunt Jemima, artists during the 1960s and 1970s “manipulated them for effect, deconstructing the visual sign, questioning Aunt Jemima's role as a popular trademark, and giving voice and humanity to all the black women aggrieved by the stereotypical representation of Aunt Jemima and the mammy image.”96 Calvin Reid also notes the influence of Robert Colescott and David Hammons and their use of appropriation on Charles's work.97\nCharles's approach to such trademark images, however, diverges from that of earlier artists because his work condemns the stereotypes less clearly. Unlike his Black Art predecessors, Charles presents a more ambiguous attitude toward these trademarked images. He typically relies on "},"document":{"title":"Parodies of Ownership: Hip-Hop Aesthetics and Intellectual Property Law","author":"Schur, Richard L.","publisher":"The University of Michigan Press and The University of Michigan Library","id":18,"isbn":"9780472024490"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":5543,"display_name":"Appropriation art"},"id":16350,"ring_next":3867,"ring_prev":3860},{"basket":{"id":5548,"display_name":"Aunt Jemima"},"id":16364,"ring_next":3873,"ring_prev":3775},{"basket":{"id":5600,"display_name":"Clorox bleach"},"id":16547,"ring_next":3765,"ring_prev":3765},{"basket":{"id":5602,"display_name":"Colescott, Robert"},"id":16553,"ring_next":3932,"ring_prev":3775},{"basket":{"id":5642,"display_name":"Copyright symbols in art"},"id":16755,"ring_next":3868,"ring_prev":3859},{"basket":{"id":5653,"display_name":"Cultural imagination"},"id":16804,"ring_next":3866,"ring_prev":3835},{"basket":{"id":5690,"display_name":"Fair Use -- Racialized Doctrine"},"id":16953,"ring_next":3865,"ring_prev":3849},{"basket":{"id":5724,"display_name":"Hammons, David"},"id":17064,"ring_next":3891,"ring_prev":3760},{"basket":{"id":5728,"display_name":"Harris, Michael"},"id":17072,"ring_next":3866,"ring_prev":3866},{"basket":{"id":5758,"display_name":"Inheritance, cultural"},"id":17262,"ring_next":3757,"ring_prev":3856},{"basket":{"id":5870,"display_name":"Ownership -- Cultural"},"id":17652,"ring_next":3875,"ring_prev":3856},{"basket":{"id":5871,"display_name":"Ownership -- Economic"},"id":17671,"ring_next":3887,"ring_prev":3857},{"basket":{"id":5877,"display_name":"Ownership -- Public memory"},"id":17706,"ring_next":3875,"ring_prev":3817},{"basket":{"id":5879,"display_name":"Ownership -- Visual culture"},"id":17728,"ring_next":3892,"ring_prev":3835},{"basket":{"id":5891,"display_name":"Pillsbury Dough Boy"},"id":17781,"ring_next":3867,"ring_prev":3867},{"basket":{"id":5910,"display_name":"Post–Civil Rights era -- Cultural production"},"id":17864,"ring_next":3906,"ring_prev":3856},{"basket":{"id":5928,"display_name":"Property rights -- (in) Raced images"},"id":18032,"ring_next":3872,"ring_prev":3856},{"basket":{"id":5958,"display_name":"Rockwell, Norman"},"id":18145,"ring_next":3868,"ring_prev":7106},{"basket":{"id":6022,"display_name":"Trademark -- (and) Racialization"},"id":18367,"ring_next":3864,"ring_prev":3858},{"basket":{"id":5793,"display_name":"Whitehead, Colson"},"id":18454,"ring_next":3869,"ring_prev":3862},{"basket":{"id":6057,"display_name":"Wonder Woman"},"id":18501,"ring_next":3873,"ring_prev":7138},{"basket":{"id":6058,"display_name":"Wood, Grant"},"id":18503,"ring_next":3873,"ring_prev":3873}],"localid":"page_125","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/OEBPS/chap5.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<a id=\"page_125\">","css_selector":"#page_125","xpath":"a[@id=\"page_125\"]"},"next_location_id":3864,"previous_location_id":3862}]
