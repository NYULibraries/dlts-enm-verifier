Such discussions were not about music in general—itself a field of considerable importance that engaged virtually all of the young people with varying degrees of intensity. Indeed, they listened to music frequently, most of them every day. However, many of their preferences found little resonance either at school or in out-of-school music lessons.4 The more street-wise boys preferred “Grime” (London-centric rap). Several of the girls listened to “Top 40” (mainstream popular hits). Abby, Dilruba, and Salma liked Top 40 but focused on black artists, especially women such as Rhianna and Beyoncé. Sebastian and Dom liked mainstream “Indie Pop,” Sergei liked “Dubstep,” and Joel liked “Retro Rock.”5 But Catherine’s questions were about how the students might demonstrate the playing of an instrument as an accomplishment, recognizing that out-of-school lessons were conventionally focused on classical music. If they were playing an instrument, Catherine invariably asked what grade they were at, referring to the examination system controlled by the Royal Academy of Music or similar bodies, where students progress through graded examinations that are often taken as markers of achievement.6\nWhile all members of the class had group music lessons at school, just nine told us that they were currently learning to play or perform music outside the school. Several more said that they had had lessons when younger but no longer pursued music. This was, in itself, a far from equitably distributed privilege, as shown in table 9.1. Although the table’s classification by relative wealth may be too simple, it shows stark differences regarding which young people had access to the possibility of music lessons and who was excluded.\nThe picture is clear. The opportunity to learn music is heavily influenced by social class, unsurprising insofar as all the young people currently learning music were learning it out of school, where lessons are relatively expensive; no one in the class was taking up the school’s offer of lessons at a subsidized cost. There were more girls than boys taking these lessons, suggesting that playing an instrument "},"document":{"title":"The Class: Living and Learning in the Digital Age","author":"Sonia Livingstone and Julian Sefton-Green","publisher":"New York University Press","id":34,"isbn":"9781479824243"},"context":null,"occurrences":[{"basket":{"id":10878,"display_name":"Catherine (class teacher) -- at Progress Day"},"id":34248,"ring_next":7764,"ring_prev":7647},{"basket":{"id":11588,"display_name":"music learning -- school music lessons"},"id":35772,"ring_next":7657,"ring_prev":7657},{"basket":{"id":11593,"display_name":"music learning -- young people's preferences"},"id":35786,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":11740,"display_name":"school -- music lessons at"},"id":36176,"ring_next":7657,"ring_prev":7657},{"basket":{"id":11591,"display_name":"social class -- music learning influenced by"},"id":36393,"ring_next":null,"ring_prev":null},{"basket":{"id":10905,"display_name":"young people"},"id":36727,"ring_next":7717,"ring_prev":7583}],"localid":"page_191","pagenumber":{"filepath":"/ops/xhtml/chapter9.xhtml","pagenumber_tag":"<span epub:type=\"pagebreak\" id=\"pg_191\" title=\"191\">","css_selector":"#pg_191","xpath":"span[@id=\"pg_191\"]"},"next_location_id":7654,"previous_location_id":7652}]
