        "pageText":"guards found them. Boyle bleeding pretty good and rolled into a ball. . . . Boo-Boo, who is not right in the head, more confused than anything else.\nAt mail-call on the same day they brought Morris Boyle back to lockdown the fat guard asks what I would’ve done, he has two letters for me in his hand—“Listen, he says, “if you’d found out about the contract before we did . . . what then? Maybe think about asking for protective custody, huh?”\nHe holds the letters just beyond my reach. “And what about after leaving here,” he asks. “If it follows right along—anywhere you’re transferred . . .”\nNickerson is his name. He holds my letters chest high. He wants me to look at him.\nThis is what he’d like me to think about: how it would be about money, period . . . if I was in population there would be no one person to go after—nothing I could do to make everyone stand back. And every night, sleeping in an open bay dorm—less than two feet between row after row of double bunks, the bunks themselves and clothes hanging and string lines making the whole dorm a blind spot. . . .\n“We can’t see shit, my friend,” he tells me.\n“Who would it be,” he asks. “Sooner or later . . .”\nNickerson shrugs his shoulders.\n",
