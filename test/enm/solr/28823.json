        "pageText":"Content Comprehensible for English Learners: The SIOP Model. The SIOP offerings by the central office were in addition to the ESL endorsement required of all teachers.\n      This emphasis on language services was prevalent throughout the district, and it is a theme that reemerges in later chapters. The point here is that it was a key way in which the central office engaged diversity-related work, and it was a reactive response stemming from a convergence of interests and significant federal pressure. Interests converged because the district had a high stake in both avoiding federal sanctions and advancing its reputation as a responsive and “equity-oriented” institution, and the Latino community had a high stake in the quality of schooling young people received. But the actual policies and practices emanating from these interests converging represent a low-cost approach because educators’ investments in whiteness are hardly touched by efforts aimed at assimilating students into the dominant culture. The focus on language is also a decidedly nice approach to engaging diversity since it emphasizes inclusion into the mainstream, dominant linguistic fold.\n      Refugee Services\n      In addition to language services, refugee students and their families were also on the forefront of a number of district initiatives and funding decisions. The Salt Lake Valley has long been a United Nations refugee relocation site, so there has been a large population of refugees in Utah since at least the 1970s. During the late 1970s and 1980s, the majority of refugee students came from Southeast Asian and Eastern European countries. By 2005, the vast majority of refugee students were from African countries, primarily the Congo, Sudan, and Somalia. These students had often spent their entire lives in refugee camps and had little or no access to schooling or the English language. This presented a unique challenge for the Zion School District since it was the first time it saw so many students who were nonliterate in their own language, came from families who spoke no English, and had no history of formal schooling.\n      According to every central office leader with whom I spoke, the Zion School District’s recent focus on refugee students and services was the direct result of the arrival of Somali Bantu youth.2 One district leader explained that “previous refugee groups from Eastern European countries seemed to integrate fairly quickly,” but that with the current group of refugees, “we are training them almost as infants because they come with little or no formal schooling and have lived their entire lives in refugee camps.” The district hired a private consultant to work exclusively ",
