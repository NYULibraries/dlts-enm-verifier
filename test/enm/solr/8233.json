        "pageText":"as ambition and commitment, we have gained little in “proving” that they are different, and thus not normal in the statistical or normative sense of the word. The real issue is whether a candidate’s psychological functioning is incompatible with or likely to compromise his performance of presidential responsibilities.\nYet, given that the concept of normality is not likely to prove helpful in assessing candidates’ psychological suitability, is there still cause to be concerned about these issues? Gaylin (1973, 56) asks,\nIf everyone is a little sick, if nobody is really sick, if no one knows what mental illness is anyhow, and if popular judgments tend to be based on unfounded assumptions … should we worry about the potential impact of mental illness on a man in authority? I believe, in spite of all the ambiguities and confusions, that we certainly should. (Emphasis mine)\nIn the next chapter, I try to explain why.\n\n",
