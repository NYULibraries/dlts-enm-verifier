        "pageText":"Manik” the husband achieves control over his wife not by stealing her clothes but by an act that can be compared to holding the water girl over the fire to burn away her leeches, or cutting off the cat woman’s paw, or shoeing the mare who in her human form is thus maimed, or burning the animal bride’s skin to prevent her return to nature. For from the outset Prince Amul follows closely the instructions he receives from his grand master, and tears from the swan maiden’s body her fairy wings, a more overtly brutal act than stealing her clothing: “You have found your match at last young lady; this time I shall not let you go in a hurry,” to which she replies that she is at his mercy: “I yield, prince; you have beaten me fairly.”47 In “The Kotwal’s Daughter,” the prince with a fairy wife who will not yield herself to him asks in anger, “What’s the use of this marriage to me?” From the beginning he decides that surely it will not “beat [him] to master one weak woman.” Of the three husbands, he needs the least help from a grand master to dominate his wife, his masculinity as defined by patriarchal culture being already quite developed at the beginning of the story.48\nThus, in a noteworthy progression, “The Perfumer’s Daughter” describes how a prince’s maturity, as defined by his people, derives from his developing obedience to an older male model; “Prince Amul Manik” depicts a prince lacking initiative of his own but sufficiently respectful of patriarchal values to steel himself against feminine allure and to follow the lessons of his mentor; and “The Kotwal’s Daughter” supplies an almost ideal portrait of a prince portrayed as already so manly as to require from his teacher only the merest outline for a plan to subdue his fairy wife. He can supply the specific strategies for himself.\nThe Pawnee similarly tell a tale in which to win a wife from the otherworld is visible proof of masculine power. When the uncles of a dead woman visit her grave and her spirit emerges from it, her husband must hold her fast: as the young man holds the girl, she “jumped up and down” and he was “thrown upon the ground and she got away.” When she sees him again, she taunts him with, “Why, young man, you have no strength at all.” She warns him that a fourth escape will mean the final end to their union: “Young man, if you care for me and want me to stay with you, you must use more strength than you have shown.” Significantly, he must hold her until her uncles come and touch her. In a brutal and perhaps sexually symbolic gesture, he “puts his legs around her,” at ",
