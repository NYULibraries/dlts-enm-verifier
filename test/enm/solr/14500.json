        "pageText":"mercenary. The first implies uncritical acceptance of claims advanced by persons of higher social rank. In families that B. Bernstein (1971) has called positional, questioning of the validity of claims is seen as unnecessary or is even prohibited. It is known in advance that the father, as head of the family, is always right, that the mother is right unless the father opposes her, and so on. The world of the child splits into two circles: one contains all the persons whom he has to obey, another those whom he does not. It has been keenly observed the satisfaction with which the obedient child ignores the claims of adults belonging to the latter group. Mercenary obedience also makes the control of the validity of claims unnecessary, since it is based on profit and loss accounting. Many parents introduce their offspring into dull pragmatism by explicating moral duties in terms of profitability, and by disdaining reasons that may bring, if observed, unpleasant consequences.\nMany a fact from the vast pool of facts collected by the Oliners confirms this description. It should be noted that members of the middle and upper-middle classes—where, according to Bernstein (1971), positional families are rare—were clearly overrepresented in the sample of rescuers. That can mean that many rescuers had the opportunity in their childhood to learn to examine the validity of claims or at least had avoided severe obedience training. Indeed, the rescuers reported more often than nonrescuers that their parents rejected both blind obedience and pragmatic attitudes toward conflict situations. Even more interesting are the differences in disciplinary measures used by the parents. Both rescuers and nonrescuers reported that their parents used punishment of various sorts, but the former more often mentioned that the parental disapproval was accompanied by the verbal explication of their reasons. The authors interpret that effect in a rather complex way as a modeling of the correct relation of the strong to the weak: when parents—the stronger part in the interaction—explain why they are dissatisfied with the child instead of just scolding or spanking him, they demonstrate to him how to resign the domination over the weaker part. I think it can be seen in a simpler way. Giving the reasons for parental disapproval instructs the child to take a reflective, critical attitude toward every claim before he accepts it. Unwarranted disapproval, on the other hand, shifts his attention from the claim itself to the position of its source. Little wonder that many nonrescuers perceived punishments inflicted upon them ",
