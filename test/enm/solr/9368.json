        "pageText":"summer. I was ordered to stand erect, facing the wall, all day long, and whoever passed by would hit me. My hands were chained behind my back, and they became all swollen and hurt a great deal. I lost all sensation in two fingers, probably due to some nerve damage. But one of the wardens was nice, and at night would remove the handcuffs and clean my wounds. All that week they didn’t give me any food, so he had pity on me and late one night brought me some baked goods with halvah from the marketplace. This food, however, made me terribly thirsty, and then it gave me diarrhea. I felt I was dehydrating. I remember standing there and feeling how my tongue was swelling in my mouth. I was hallucinating: I saw a pile of soft drink cans in front of me. I knew that they were all empty except for two, but I had only one chance of making a choice. … I was dressed in extra big pants, which I had received from the Egyptians, and in that condition, while I was defecating in my pants, with my ankles black from infection, I managed to pull one of the pants legs aside, so that I dirtied just one of my legs, while the other remained clean. It’s hard to describe the sense of mastery I felt from this achievement, the feeling that I can take good care of myself!\nSince I couldn’t stand all night long, I would sit down on the concrete slab, standing up the moment I heard the door open. This was a game, in which I was winning every time I wasn’t caught sitting.\nIn the morning they cleaned the floor. How? By pouring two buckets of water on the floor and sweeping it away. Since my cell was lower than the corridor, water flowed into the room, and I’d kneel down and drink it. When I started to taste dirt, I knew I had enough. I didn’t feel it was terrible at the time, because this was my reality then and there: not to be caught sitting down and to find water when thirst was my punishment. Such deeds made me feel in control of my situation.\nSometimes they would punish me with starvation. This was some time later, when I was already in a solitary room at Abassiya jail and I was “bad.” Every time I was taken to the toilet, I’d find something to eat in the garbage pail. I think these were the dogs’ leftovers. Finally, after a long time of starvation, they brought me food—some beans on a plate.
