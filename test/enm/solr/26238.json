        "pageText":"Modern legal positivists believe that problems of legal indeterminacy (the failure of rules to guide decision-makers to correct answers) were minor difficulties in decision making that could be resolved by institutional choices based on the competency of the decision maker to resolve ambiguity in language. Hart argued that legal terms had a core of settled meaning and a penumbra of debatable meaning.30 In the core, judges must decide a case by following the settled meaning of legal terms. In the penumbra, judges are allowed to make a policy choice similar to the one typically rendered by legislators.\nThe core-penumbra distinction was a new normative basis for synthesizing the tension between formalism and instrumentalism. In the core, judges would be formalists. In the penumbra, judges would be policy instrumentalists. Logical consistency characteristic of Langdellian formalists was therefore relegated to the judiciary function. The open-ended nature of Holmesian instrumentalism was justified by the judiciary only when courts were required to perform a legislative-like function. In Hart’s famous example involving a hypothetical statute prohibiting vehicles in the park, for example, Hart asked whether such a statute should apply to a bicycle. Hart’s answer was that judges must determine if the word “bicycle” fell within the core or penumbra of the dictionary definition for the word “vehicle.” Hart assumed that the rule excluded cars and trucks since they were in the rule’s “core” of settled meaning and application.31 Bicycles, however, fell within the penumbra, thus allowing judges to render a policy decision. The indeterminacy to be filled in by legal decision makers was therefore limited to cases following the “penumbra” of debatable meaning.32\nLegal positivism as practiced in English jurisprudence never really caught on in America for a number of reasons. First, as Gilmore had noted, the “trauma” of the American Revolution and the events that led to the War of 1812 “instilled in many, perhaps in most Americans, a hatred of England and all its ways.”33 Those events turned American lawyers and judges away from English legal materials in the early history of the common law. This Anglophobia in the early history of America contributed to the foundation of a uniquely American jurisprudence.\nEnglish legal positivism was also largely unsuited for America because American lawyers needed an interpretive theory of law to explain and justify what America’s highest appellate court, the United States Supreme Court, was doing—namely, revising, reinterpreting, and sometimes ",
