Gradually we changed our whole way of life. But in the beginning they were the old-timers, and by virtue of their seniority they had a relative advantage over us.\nAt first everything revolved around food and eating. They used to play canasta, and in the evening they told plots of films to one another. There were a few books there that everybody read. They wrote letters. After we arrived we began to define the day: when to eat, when to prepare food, when to wake up, when it was permitted to make noise. After about two months we started the Friday meetings, and after that lessons—all this in an attempt to build a system with more value.\nAt first, we were unorganized. Just being together was the experience. Getting up in the morning stretched from eight to ten o’clock and sometimes until noon, each according to his own time; it was forbidden to make noise. An order was formed naturally of those who got up early and those who got up late; this prevented lines at the toilet. But the morning was unorganized; everyone did what he liked, read, exercised. The first focus was the noon meal—what would we prepare for today? What kind of soup should we make and who should prepare it? Conditions were still very bad. There were no cooking utensils; there was one knife that the old-timers had found. It was a German pocket knife, just a blade, really, for which we later constructed a handle. There was one electric hot plate, on which we did everything, including the laundry. We didn’t do any complicated cooking—we got most of our food from the Egyptians, mixed with the packages from home. We didn’t yet buy from the canteen. The food was poor, but we made an enormous business out of preparing it. I remember, for example, baking our first cake. We got flour from home, but needed to improvise baking utensils. We finally put the mixture into one pot and a larger pot on top of it—and out came a cake. This was the first of a magnificent series of cakes. We baked cakes for every Friday—we had a festive Friday night meal—and afterwards another cake for Sabbath morning. They brought us an oven and we achieved magnificent results with whipped cream and fruit.\n",
