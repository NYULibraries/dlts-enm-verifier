        "pageText":"he told the reporter. But in fact Garland was still a child and, like so many tough kids, underneath he was scared. “I guess I been scared all my life. For me, living has been the same as running through hell with a gasoline suit on. I don’t want people to feel sorry for me, but I really ain’t had nothing good happen to me. The ax fell heavy on my head.”     Garland Hampton was convicted of murder. In sentencing, Judge White was favorably impacted by the environmental hardship defense and rejected the prosecution’s recommendation that the parole date be set in sixty-five years. Stating that she was giving “considerable weight to the background and circumstances of Garland Hampton,” she imposed a life sentence with a parole date of twenty years.\n6.

Lawyers have to make political choices. An example of a law firm grappling with the issue of whether or not to represent a person involved in activity that has a negative impact on the community is Ken Cockrel and Justin Ravitz’s decision not to defend heroin dealers. In a 1973 newspaper interview entitled “Revolutionary in a Legal Sheepskin,” Cockrel said, “We don’t represent dealers in heroin and other opium derivatives, although . . . there have been cases where we could have written our own ticket. But how could I go out in the community and speak out against heroin if I came out in a Mark IV that I got by defending dope traffickers.”     Cockrel and Ravitz are not the only lawyers who have faced hard choices.
