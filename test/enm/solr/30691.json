        "pageText":"and tableware amount to human hardware that is not merely human: the table bends the body, directs the visual apparatus, puts things within reach, and is a prosthesis by which a kinesthetic body rises to the occasion. So we should emphasize again the self-estrangement that is entailed in the name of propriety, failing as such efforts do to fulfill the basic demands of the bodily appetite for food and drink. There is no question of allowing the diner simply and easily to feed and fill up the body. Lydgate’s “Dietary” teaches that one should leave the meal with some appetite remaining, and Caxton’s The Book of Curtesye teaches the child to curb “uncurteys appetyte.”106 The goal everywhere is temperate diet: “mesure is a mery meene.”107 As Trigg observes, “the art of fine eating is the art of not seeming to need to eat.”108 The table is the place where one modifies desires and modulates gestures to such an extent that being there is not primarily about fulfilling the appetites whetted at table. It is about sacrificing natural function to make room for an insentient thing. The table is at once an implement and impediment to desire. Propriety at mealtime, like poetry, is something like the gross inefficiency of objects coming between subjects (at least from the point of view of those seeking greater efficiencies), deforming consumption thereby. In the evolutionary sense, the table is not adaptive. It takes priority over the human, who must adapt to the strictures of the thing.\n        Consuming Animals\n        Derrida’s limitrophy is above all meant to articulate the messy line separating species, namely, the limit of which he says “we have had a stomachful,” the “limit between Man with a capital M and Animal with a capital A.”109 And here, too, the table intervenes, enacting a limit by crossing species, mixing hard materials and soft, fleshy bits of animals.\n        There is a whole zoogastronomy of the table to consider. A domestic animal eating crumbs fallen from the table must have been a common sight.110 Hunting dogs were companion animals that helped secure the meat, and they may have enjoyed some animal flesh nearby in the dining hall. Chaucer’s Prioress is memorably described as feeding her lapdogs the finer food that graced the table (roasted flesh, milk, and white bread).111 Whole animals, or large parts of them, were typically brought out into the open and prepared for carving at table.
