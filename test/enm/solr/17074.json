        "pageText":"THE CALVINIST REFORMATION\nWhile the split between Roman Catholics and Protestants was the major division within western Christianity, Protestant reformers themselves quickly fragmented into different sects. For example, by the mid-1520s, the Anabaptists had splintered off because they insisted that baptism during infancy was invalid and that true believers therefore should be baptized as adults. These divisions between various Protestant sects could be severe. In 1524, for instance, Luther managed to have an Anabaptist opponent expelled from Saxony.76 Luther also fell into a serious dispute during the 1520s with Huldreich Zwingli, an early leader of the Reformation in Switzerland. In particular, they disagreed about the proper interpretation of the Eucharist or Lord’s Supper. Luther had accepted the Roman Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist, but only with qualifications. In Catholicism, the doctrine of transubstantiation determines the meaning of the ingestion of the bread and wine (during the Eucharist): supposedly, the words of the priest miraculously transform the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, thus renewing Christ’s sacrifice for humanity. Although Luther accepted the Eucharist, he only partially accepted the doctrine of transubstantiation. To Luther, the bread and wine do not actually convert into the body and blood of Jesus, but nonetheless, Jesus’ body and blood become present in the sacrament. Somehow, the body and blood of Jesus coexist with the bread and wine. To Zwingli, however, the bread and wine are merely symbolic: they represent the body and blood of Jesus, but the body and blood are never actually present during the sacrament. The disagreement between Luther and Zwingli led to the distinction within Protestantism between the Lutheran and Reformed movements.77\nJean Calvin was born in France but spent most of his adult life in Switzerland. Well educated as a humanist, Calvin was still living in France when he suddenly converted to Protestantism in 1534. Within two years, he had written the first edition of his remarkably systematic and thorough statement of reform theology, Institutes of the Christian Religion, and thus he quickly became a second-generation leader of the Reformed movement.78 On the issue of the Eucharist, Calvin tried to reach a position midway between those of Luther and Zwingli; according to Calvin, Christ was spiritually but not physically present.79 Nevertheless, in many ways, Calvin’s theological views strongly resembled those of Luther; the differences were one of degree, not of kind. Like Luther, Calvin stressed the authority of the Scriptures: “For by his Word, God rendered faith unambiguous forever.”80 To Luther, the Old Testament was relatively ",
