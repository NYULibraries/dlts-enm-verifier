Paul de Man asserts that “literature as well as criticism—the difference between them being delusive—is condemned (or privileged) to be forever the most rigorous and, consequently, the most unreliable language in terms of which man [woman] names and transforms [her-] himself.”3Barbara Johnson, who quotes de Man on this issue, explains that deconstruction “involves a reversal of values, a revaluation of the signifying function of everything that, in a sign-based theory of meaning, would constitute noise.”4 As “noise” becomes seriously examined for its signifying function, it calls into question the stability of the text’s more apparent “intention” or “meaning.” The perception of a textual content (noise), which is “at war” with the text’s more obvious rhetorical intent, should be important for any theory of rhetoric because rhetoric derives its power precisely from its ability to overcome the noise of its resistance. But this description of deconstructive practice should also have important implications for understanding the nature of the text. The presence of noise in a text implies, first, that the notion of a clearly dominant authorial intention disappears. Second, the “unstable” text offers, through the medium of noise, clear, convincing, and verifiable (one might say “objective”) evidence of its inner incoherence.\nPoststructural methodology is on the one hand more relativistic or, from a traditional perspective, more “subjective” than traditional criticism. Yet on the other hand it is also more rigorous, farsighted, and attentive to signifiers than traditional criticism. This paradoxical avowal of interpretive rigor and denial of textual presence is worth examination. If poststructural methodology is shunned by many critics, it is not because it lacks clarity, method, and rigor (properties in fact usually allied with objectivity). It is shunned because it somehow seems more irresponsible. In a word, it seems narcissistic, and narcissistic modes of reading seem to deny objective texts. In actuality poststructuralist thought, although it reveals a degree of narcissism involved in reading, does not go far enough in understanding the narcissistic nature of textual production and response.\nPoststructuralist theory seems narcissistic in the negative sense because it makes emphatic claims about the importance of the reader’s role in interpreting or constituting the text. Signifiers in the text do not disappear, but the thing signified by the signifiers becomes a product of ",
