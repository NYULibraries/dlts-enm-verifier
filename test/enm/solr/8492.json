        "pageText":"Some Limitations of Assessing Psychological Suitability during Election Campaigns\nThe assessment of character and leadership during presidential campaigns, even when partially successful, underscores several dilemmas. One arises from ambiguities in the meaning of the behavior that we see. The Biden case provides an illustration. It is clear that Senator Joe Biden borrowed important parts of another leader’s speech without attribution and that he also plagiarized a law review article when he was in law school, but what exactly does this say about his character? Does it reflect a strong need to succeed at any cost, a tendency to enter “gray” areas and err in favor of self-interest? Or does it reflect the lack of confidence, skill, or some combination of these factors?\nIn a world of more information and better theories, the answers to these questions would conceivably have some bearing on a more sophisticated assessment of a candidate’s psychological suitability. But the reality is that serious answers to these questions can’t be obtained without intimate access to the individual and painstaking research, and neither is likely to be possible during a campaign. There is, therefore, a rough but politically legitimate cutoff point to these questions in a candidacy. The fact that we cannot fully appreciate or understand in complex detail the personal motivations that underlie questionable behavior does not require citizens to forgo their discomfort and judgments about its existence.\nAnother dilemma is found in the fact that character reflects composite characteristics. A given character element or derivative may be productive or “successful” in one arena or time but not in others.10 So, for example, Dukakis’s persistent, steady approach to unfolding political events might be helpful for “long-haul” events but less helpful in response to new, dramatic developments. A strong and steady approach is an important dimension of leadership psychology, but so is the capacity for quick, effective response. To take the opposite case, a characteristic that may seem to be a matter of some concern, say, the capacity to be tough, may carry with it more positive implications for some contexts (for example, in standing up to aggressors).\nAlternative Venues for Assessing Suitability\nDuring the 1988 presidential campaign, when Gary Hart was forced to withdraw from contention because of allegations of martial infidelity, James Reston of the New York Times suggested ignoring the primaries altogether ",
