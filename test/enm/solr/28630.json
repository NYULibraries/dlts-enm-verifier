A remarkable 48 percent of those immigrants moved to Houston, one of the nation’s fastest-growing metropolitan areas, within the previous decade.\nCalifornia, on the other hand, has long served as a destination for immigrants. By 1995, however, California had also experienced a violent backlash against undocumented immigrants—especially those of Mexican descent. Proposition 187, which would have denied undocumented immigrants in California access to public schools and other publicly funded services, and the media frenzy that surrounded its passage in November 1994 made national headlines and continued to influence the immigration discourse in 1995–96. Much of the immigration discourse in Southern California, where Mexican nationals constituted the largest immigrant group by far, was thus focused on the controversy surrounding undocumented immigrants from Mexico.4 Yet since my analysis is interested in the way that national, racial, gender, and class differences between different immigrant groups informed the discourse, I decided to concentrate on San Francisco, rather than Los Angeles or San Diego.5 Due to its historical ties with Asia, San Francisco was home to a much more diverse immigrant population than metropolitan areas in the southern part of the state. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, Asians constituted 51.7 percent of the foreign-born population in San Francisco, including 124,511 Chinese, 75,571 Filipinos, and 20,771 Vietnamese immigrants. An additional 14.6 percent of immigrants in San Francisco came from Mexico, 10.6 percent from other Central American countries, and 14.2 percent from Europe.\nAs the most widely read of the nation’s papers of record, the New York Times contained the most extensive and varied coverage on immigrants and immigration reform measures. According to a keyword search on LexisNexis, the New York Times published more than 2,500 articles, editorials, and letters that dealt with some aspect of immigrants’ lives and their impact on U.S. society in a matter of two years (between January 1995 and December 1996). Congressional politics, presidential elections, and candidates’ opinions about immigration reform were of particular importance. Not only did the New York Times provide factual information about bills and amendments; journalists oftentimes commented on the political discourse itself. The New York Times coverage of congressional and presidential politics was not only interested in what was said but also in how it was said. For example, when Representative John L. Mica ",
