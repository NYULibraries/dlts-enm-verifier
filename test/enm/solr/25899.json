        "pageText":"What about the 4.4% of lesbians who expressed concerns about the difficulties bisexuals face because they are rejected by both heterosexuals and lesbians? Were they also speaking on behalf of a larger group? Apparently not—only 1% of lesbians feel that bisexuals experience more prejudice or more discrimination than lesbians, indicating that even those who are concerned about bisexuals’ special oppression do not believe that bisexuals are therefore more oppressed than lesbians.\nUnderlying Conceptualizations: Two Different Kinds of Hybrids and Apoliticality\nThe “best of both worlds” and the “worst of both worlds” represent two radically different views of the political status of bisexuals vis-à-vis heterosexual society and the lesbian community. From the “best of both worlds” perspective, bisexuals are—whether intentionally or not—apolitical opportunists who enjoy privilege, avoid oppression, and abdicate their political responsibilities in favor of personal comfort. They are fence-sitters who refuse to cast their lot with either interest group, hedging all bets by “playing it both ways.” From the “worst of both worlds” perspective, bisexuals are political victims who suffer from not only heterosexism, but also homosexism. They are caught in the middle, unable to belong to either world and rejected by both. Both perspectives rest on a conceptualization of sexuality as dichotomous and a conceptualization of bisexuality as a hybrid form of sexuality. In the “best of both worlds,” bisexuals combine the advantages of homosexuality and heterosexuality and, in the “worst of both worlds,” they combine the disadvantages. But closer analysis shows that the concepts of hybrid bisexuality underlying these different political beliefs are different.\nThe “best of both worlds” view is grounded in a concept of bisexuality as a hybrid combination of heterosexuality and lesbianism. Bisexuals can live a heterosexual lifestyle, feel comfortable in heterosexual society, and appear to be one hundred percent heterosexual. Or, they can live a lesbian lifestyle, feel comfortable in the lesbian community, and appear to be one hundred percent lesbian. Like a chameleon, at any given moment the hybrid bisexual appears to be either heterosexual or lesbian, depending on how she presents herself, whom she is dating, or whether she is among heterosexuals or lesbians. Since she is at all times both heterosexual and lesbian, she can move freely back and forth between these two lifestyles and societies. It is this ability to move freely back and forth ",
