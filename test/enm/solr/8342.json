We will then be in a position to evaluate two recent presidential campaigns, those of 1988 and 1992, in the context of psychological suitability. My purpose is to examine the degree to which the characterological elements put forward here were either evident or observable in those campaigns. We will then be in a firmer position to assess the utility of using these elements in evaluating other campaigns.\n\n",
