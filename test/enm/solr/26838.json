And although 90 percent of the clients’ suggestions are inappropriate or useless, the other 10 percent are often gems that help win the case.\nIn Steven’s case, once he was encouraged to participate in his own defense he began to play an active role. He agreed with or deferred to our judgment in almost all decisions. But he had two points he felt very strongly about. First, he refused to blame racism for his crime. Second, he would not say he was “insane” at the time of the robbery. He would not use that word. Fortunately, we agreed with him.\nOur strategy was to argue that racism is a major factor in the equation that causes a person to strike out. A different strategy is to blame racism for one’s predicament. The former has the potential to open people’s eyes to the powerful impact of environment. But the latter points the finger at others for one’s failings and results in closing people’s eyes to social reality. We chose the course that retained Steven’s dignity and pride, and rejected the course that led to pity and victimization.\nSteven took the stand as our last witness. In a typical bank robbery trial, the issue is whether or not the defendant in fact robbed the bank. He may have the defense of alibi. For example, “I was in the park with friends at the time of the crime.” So, the dispute is whether he was in the bank or in the park. The defendant’s mental state is not an issue, nor are the factors that shaped his behavior. Therefore, no testimony is allowed as to the defendant’s social background. In a psychiatric case, however, the issue for the jury is whether or not the person who admits robbing the bank was suffering from a mental state that is considered insanity under the law. A person who was “insane” at the time he committed a crime is not considered morally responsible, because he did not have knowledge of the consequences of his behavior or was not in rational control of his behavior. In such a trial the entire life of the defendant becomes relevant because it has formed his mental state. Therefore, the psychiatrist and Steven were allowed to testify to Steven’s life experience.\nSteven was born on the south side of Chicago in September 1941. His parents were divorced at an early age, and he lived with his mother and grandmother. He lived a life fairly typical of a black child in the ghetto on the south side of Chicago. His mother worked at various unskilled jobs, earning less than a dollar per hour. His grandmother cleaned white people’s ",
