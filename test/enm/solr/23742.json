It is, like the “hypnotic” effect of highly charismatic leaders, a form of communication erasing boundaries between speaker and listener and exposing “inner” self-structure to the reformulating power of “public” rhetoric.\nIn summary, if the modern self is highly divided, and if reconciling the self’s inner voices of opposition is the task of both rhetoric and self-building, then texts that activate and direct these oppositions and reconciliations embody the key principles of modern ethos. More precisely, if rhetoric is always at the scene of conflict, and if the divided nature of the self participates in this conflict—and, indeed, facilitates rhetorical action —then it follows that a particular kind of representation of self-conflict (an “aesthetic manipulation,” that is, of self-divisive conflict) provides an effective formula for ethos. In short, a distinctly “modern” ethos may well be grasped as an aesthetic manipulation of self-division.\nIt would be instructive to illustrate this claim in a writer like Bertrand Russell, who, with his ebullient confidence in argument, seems precisely the opposite of a divided self. But I defer this more complicated case of self-division in order to focus on the more simple case of George Orwell’s “Shooting an Elephant.” Orwell does not reflect all the variations in the structural principles of self-division I have tried to describe. The ethical and argumentative strategies of his essay are a bit too obvious. Nonetheless these all-too-obvious strategies may effectively support the more controversial aspects of my description of modern ethos.\nOrwell’s Ethos as an Aesthetic Manipulation of Self-Division\nEric Blair was not a great social leader, but as “George Orwell” Blair became a highly visible and “charismatic” journalist. Orwell’s charisma is very much a function of his writing style, one that still serves as a model for many teachers of writing. T. R. Fyvel, a later friend of Orwell, describes the effect Orwell’s writing had on him:\nI had spent the nineteen-thirties for the most part abroad, but already in that decade I had come to admire Orwell’s first novels and his journalism, and I thought of him as the English writer whom upon my return to England I would above all love to meet.35\nA number of critics have commented on a sense of personal presence, the presence of the living writer, experienced while reading Orwell.
