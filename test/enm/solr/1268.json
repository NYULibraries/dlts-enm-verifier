For example, the OED sought to plumb the depths of English, with the more citations per word the better.26\nThe second facet made plain by the collapse of author and audience is that of the general audience: perhaps wiki epistemology works best when the audience is general. For Diderot, his readers were his writers. The OED, believe it or not, was also intended for the general public, not the philological few. And Wikipedia is the first reference for generalists, not PhDs.\nViewed in historical context and in light of these notable similarities, wikis no longer appear to be an aberration in the history of composition. They are not revolutionary. The advantages of collaborative writing preceded wikis and will endure long after them as well. Wikis are a great technology, but they by no means offer a unique approach to composition. Consider for a minute the little magnetic words many people have on their refrigerators. They approximate a surrealist game from the 1920s—taking words out of context to find new meanings in them. The surrealists played games like exquisite corpse, where one person writes down a definite or indefinite article and an adjective, the next person a noun, the third person a verb, and so on, each without looking at what the previous person wrote. The final sentence often has unexpected meaning. “Surrealist texts obtained simultaneously by several people writing from such to such a time in the same room, collaborative efforts . . . brought out into the open a strange possibility of thought, which is that of its pooling.”27 The new collaborative meaning is precisely predicated on not reading what the others write before editing it. In this way, you discard your personal will and meaning and succumb to a group intention.28\nThis brings us back to the question, Can the process of constructing a social justice wiki really promote equality? As we saw, wikis, like other collaborative efforts, value the process as much as the product—the community engendered is a major benefit of writing in them. It is not the wiki technology per se that engenders equality but the collaborative effort on social justice (which raises the question, Would a wiki on social injustice promote inequity?). When we share an endeavor, perforce we share goals. Sharing goals and working together, we come to share values. The shared values and aspirations describe a world that we, as a group, believe to be better. Thus, wiki or no, together we make the world better.\n",
