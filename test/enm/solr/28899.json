        "pageText":"equal opportunity that characterize the powerblind, colorblind formal equality seen at Spruce.\n      Normativity in the Presence of Difference\n      Though rooted in sameness, formal equality does allow recognition of, and some remediation around, difference. Recall that Spruce teachers did engage difference as it related to the language and social-class backgrounds of their students. These engagements were similarly framed by a powerblind, colorblind formal equality—a pattern that is highlighted in the ways Spruce teachers discussed and employed the book Seedfolks in the language arts program. This book is fairly explicit in addressing issues of language, culture, race, and social class, but teachers at Spruce engaged it under a powerblind, colorblind formal equality framework that emphasized meritocracy and equal opportunity. During an interview with a teacher who taught the ESL language arts class, Ms. Scott described this book and why she believed it was a particularly effective text with her ELL students:\n      \n        One example of the books that I use in class is Seedfolks, and each chapter is different. Nearly everyone is a different person from a different country who has come to the United States to live; and if they haven’t come from another country, they’ve at least come from different parts of the United States, and so they are from different ethnic backgrounds. And we read that book and talk about all these different people. We talk about their traditions and a little bit about their culture; and again, I don’t think I do a great job with it, but it’s a nice book to start out the school year because some of the issues that are addressed in the book are issues that I think these kids are dealing with.\n        For example, there is a kid from Guatemala who says something to the effect of, “When you’re old and come to the United States, you come to be like a baby, and the babies or the kids turn to adults.” And he says that because he’s in eighth grade, and he has to do all the translating for his dad or his mom when they go to the store, or when they pay the rent, or when they have a problem with a landlord. Well, so many of my kids, that’s very familiar to them; they know what that’s like. The kid in the story says he learned English from watching TV. You know, my kids always get a big kick out of that because they say that really helped them. So they can relate to it more than something that’s totally just Western American. So, I see them liking it and enjoying it more, and I think maybe getting more out of it than maybe some other books.\n      \n      ",
