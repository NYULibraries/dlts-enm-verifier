        "pageText":"\nCHAPTER 7\nAll Hell Breaks Loose\nLaunch, Sales, and Critical Reception\nWe're nearly ready to take a stroll through Hell and hit the game in detail, but before we do that, we need to look at what happened on December 10, 1993, the day that (to hijack W. B. Yeats) a “rough beast, its hour come round at last,” slouched onto the University of Wisconsin's FTP system to be born. I've already spent a little time setting the context for DOOM's launch, but it's worth reiterating some of that, for reasons that will become clear.\nIn 1993, we've got a few home consoles on the market, and they are doing fairly well. Sony is twelve months away from launching the first PlayStation in Japan and twenty-one months from a European and North American release. There is little crossover between console and PC gaming. As Romero noted, PC games are largely more complex, sluggish affairs. Home computer games have, of course, been around since the early 1980s, but graphics as we know them now are still in their comparative infancy. Equally, this is prior to game retail chains and any kind of formal online distribution like Steam. Internet access happens for most users through modems (56.6 kilobytes per second is a reasonable speed), and there's no World Wide Web yet. E-mail is around, of course, as well as text-based things like Gopher, Telnet, bulletin board systems, and the occasional MUD. But there's a hardcore community (or network of communities) online who are already trading information and, more important, files, an embryonic online distribution network. Frans Mäyrä sees this as a time of rapid expansion, arguing that DOOM's success is closely tied to the explosion of the Internet around this time.\n",
