They recognize that assimilating the newcomers is critical for the city's cultural recovery.\nWhether the newcomers will simply participate in the physical rebuilding of the city or will become part of the social structure of the new New Orleans is still an open question. The tension between providing assistance to newcomers and hoping that they will assimilate was evident at a public meeting of the City of New Orleans Human Relations Commission whose agenda was to hear the concerns of the Latino community. This meeting was held in June 2007, and forty to fifty members of the Hispanic community turned out for the event.\nThe newcomer Latinos and their advocates were concerned with workers' rights, police harassment, and other social justice issues.

Their migration experiences allowed them to maintain this dual loyalty. Typically, established Latinos' entry into the United States did not involve a clandestine trip over the border, breaking laws, or avoiding detection. Often they entered seeking refuge from countries undergoing revolutions and civil wars where legal disorder reigned. Or they arrived as sponsored family members of those already legally in the United States. Many have naturalized, although some maintain citizenship in their origin country. Their warm reception has allowed them to be politically active, although\n",
