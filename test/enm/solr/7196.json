That’s impossible. But if it’s something you care about you owe it to yourself to do your best to learn what you can as a reasonable person and get a decent understanding of what’s going on.”\nMany of the youth we interviewed experienced the pushback against Kony 2012 as a repudiation of their values and beliefs. One of them, Molly, reported, “I think after Kony 2012 we were kind of walking on eggshells with what we posted online and what we said.… I feel like we were bullied. People were picking at every little thing and we were nervous and we were kind of just like we had been around for so long and people stuck with us and we’re going to keep our voice.… We’re not going to stop because somebody is posting on our Facebook that we’re a scam or liars.” As Kony 2012 spread, it also reached youth who were not directly involved with IC. For example, 15-year-old Theo, a member of the Nerdfighter community discussed in the next chapter, mentioned his encounter with Kony 2012 when interviewed about his experience with Nerdfighteria. At first, he found the film “very moving” but later had “second thoughts” about getting involved as he encountered critiques of IC’s finances. Kevin, another Nerdfighter we interviewed, felt that the critiques leveraged against Kony 2012 actually applied to online activism more generally as it became clear that many people who may have shared the film “didn’t investigate the issue at all.”\nWhile some of the young IC supporters felt that they experienced most of the pushback online, even as they received support from classmates and family at the local level, others found that the online controversy brought the issues into their everyday interactions within their school communities. Natalie, a recent high school graduate, reported, “I think the reason I’m afraid of criticism is because the kids at my school ",
