Meanwhile, it can be noted that Richard Dorson’s description of the methods followed by the Irish collector T. C. Croker is probably at least partially true of many from whom folklorists must recapture the folk narratives of the past: at that\nearly date [1860s] Croker did not, as his accusers make plain, observe the precise methods of the modern folklorist. He inflates a kernel of spoken legend into a full story. Hence the sighting of a mermaid by a country fellow, which could be related in a few sentences, becomes a sketch of the stage Irishman sportively conversing with the sea beauty and plighting his troth before a perplexed priest.37\nDorson’s use of the word “accusers” reveals how seriously the folklorist takes such contamination of the original oral rendition (which itself may be suspect because it is often impossible to know whether it has been corrupted by literary analogues transmitted, for example, by missionaries or teachers who worked among the “folk”). But his argument may be tinged here as elsewhere with irony: “the purist approach to defining and collecting folk tales by the touchstone of oral currency is gradually being refuted by poaching literary historians.”38 Rigorously applied, the purist approach would insist that Lady Drower’s Iraqi tales border on “fakelore”39 despite her scrupulous intentions. Like countless other collections, hers would be consigned to some netherworld, excluded from serious study as neither true folklore nor created literature.\nMoreover, fakelore—often the product of a literary imagination schooled in folklore—does a great deal to elucidate a complex folklore pattern studied in its variety and multiplicity. The literary scholar who turns to folklore may wish to reverse the inquiry’s direction, to move from supposedly sophisticated literature back to folk tales, acquiring an increased respect for the folk’s insight, to discover in early, anonymous narratives the complexity and ambiguity in human motives that later writers would consciously recognize and draw upon.40 Without dissenting from Bengt Holbek’s distinction between genuine folklore and collections such as The Arabian Nights,41 I will frequently move among different fields of story for the mutual illumination they supply. Again, folklore characters and narrative motifs constitute an idiom that many unschooled storytellers understood as well as their literary successors.\nLady Drower was a self-conscious folklorist when she put together ",
