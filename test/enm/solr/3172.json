In its desertion and disuse, unreal estate insistently invites these questions.\nFurtive inhabitation can be fleeting, lasting as long as a yoga pose is held in a vacant lot; it can persist through the time that trespassing explorers remain undetected in an abandoned building; in the form of a squat, it can last as long as any other form of dwelling. There are vicarious forms of furtive inhabitation, like the seed bombing of an empty field. And furtive inhabitation can remain secret, something that need not be disclosed, publicized or otherwise represented. In the city of unreal estate, neglected and empty spaces can thus be occupied while seeming to remain neglected and empty all the while.\n\n\n\n",
