        "pageText":"Americans invariably ask about freeloading in such a situation. What keeps members of such groups from simply letting others do their work? When there are no sanctions that apply to individuals, why don’t some people do their best to get out of the work? Why don’t some people take advantage of the efforts of others and get “credit” for work they have not done?\nJapanese also recognize that such problems can arise, but they nonetheless often treat these questions as puzzling, the sort of thing foreigners ask about—reasonable questions, but not ones they themselves worry about much. I got the same reaction to this question that I got when I asked why children compete so wholeheartedly in Sports Day, when there are no prizes. The underlying feeling was that it is natural and fun to join in the activities of han groups, that it is obviously self-defeating behavior to “get out of” those activities.\nSam and Ellen, too, said that freeloading was not a problem in han activities in school in Japan, though it happened sometimes, and both think such behavior is a noticeable aspect of group activities in the United States. As observers, we are left with the problem of analyzing why participation seems natural in the Japanese context, and freeloading seems natural in the United States.\nThe most general answer to this question lies in the role of socialization agents—teachers, parents, and other adults. Absolute conviction is very convincing. When children spend most of their time with adults who have firmly internalized the notion that participation in group activities is natural and rewarding, they become convinced of the same thing. After all, an appetite for social interaction at some level of intensity is a part of the nature of humans as a species, and everyone is susceptible to having that part of their nature nurtured and emphasized. At a less general level, however, we must look at specific social mechanisms that encourage this view of social life rather than the equally natural one that leads to freeloading and the suspicion that others will freeload.\n",
