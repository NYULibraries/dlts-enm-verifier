        "pageText":"imprints a figure upon metal, the metal, which itself is one thing, begins to represent a different thing, not just on the outside, but from its own power and its natural aptitude to do so.”61 What is this power and natural aptitude? Metals have a knack for bonding, blending, and spreading, and medieval theory and practice acknowledge the fact. Smiths were in the business of producing moveable goods, not just properties to be possessed and consumed but also itinerant and alienable things. Flowing out of London, fine pewter makes the city more of a conduit than a center—a threshold between Cornwall and the Continent. English pewter is not a solid state, and nor is it the property of England. The metal is mobile, mutable, and, despite appearances (because metals give every indication of fixity), fluid. Indeed, a basic advantage of metals over other raw materials is that they can be founded (from Latin fundere, “melt, pour”), and, as the medieval metallurgists and Chaucer’s Canon’s Yeoman’s Tale indicate, they are therefore “fusible.”62 Unlike horn, wood, or stone, metals can be reduced to a molten liquid and assembled into nearly infinite shapes. The third and longest book of De diversis artibus (circa 1200), by the pseudonymous Theophilus, is devoted to metalwork, and a quick glance is instructive for what it reveals about the particular value of fusibility.63 Metals can be cast, soldered, worked on a lathe, and, depending on their relative ductility and malleability, beaten, stretched, stamped, twisted, and, in the end, melted down again. Pewterers found themselves beholden to the properties of tin, which exhibited its own special advantages. Tin was abundant and close by; it has a low melting point, requiring fewer secondary resources (i.e., wood fuel) than other metals; and because it resists corrosion, it protects other materials and withstands long exposure outside. Inexpensive and extremely versatile, tin is naturally inclined to bond and blend with many other materials (through soldering and tinning) and to insinuate itself into a range of human activities (through tinfoil decorations in books and paintings, the mass production of tin ware, and alchemy). Actively lending itself to relations, the metal may seem highly impressionable. And yet such cheap material was also a volatile or mercurial actor, in no way reducible to human relations. Pewter is ambiguous by nature because the exact composition is almost impossible to determine.64 It presents an opportunity for counterfeiting or, at least, for exploiting a resemblance to luxury goods (silverware or ornamental silver leaf).
