        "pageText":"rise to fantasies of engulfment in which something or someone else incorporates or swallows a person, takes over his will, smothers him with possessive, pressuring love, fixes him in formulas which he feels he cannot escape, blots out his sense of a separate self, draws him into an identification so complete that there is little or nothing left of him apart from this mergence with the other person. Rilke makes the threat of engulfment a focus of interest in the final section of The Notebooks, Malte’s reinterpretation of the Prodigal Son story as “the legend of a man who didn’t want to be loved” (251).\nThis version of the parable of the Prodigal Son is a vehicle for Rilke’s fear that intimacy opens one to the danger of being effaced and changed through and through into the person or nonperson other people need one to be:\nOnce you walked into [the] full smell [of the house], most matters were already decided ... on the whole you were ... the person they thought you were; the person for whom they had long ago fashioned a life, out of his small past and their own desires; the creature belonging to them all, who stood day and night under the influence of their love, between their hope and their mistrust, before their approval or their blame....\nCan he stay and conform to this lying life of approximations which they have assigned to him, and come to resemble them all in every feature of his face? (253-54).\nThe final sections of the novel emphasize the fear of being loved. In the margin of The Notebooks manuscript Malte has written, “To be loved means to be consumed.... To be loved is to pass away” (250). He imagines that the Prodigal Son often thought of the troubadours as men who feared more than anything else that the woman they longed for might reciprocate their love (255). Malte seems to project onto them his fantasy that any woman who loved him would engulf him. His illness and isolation recall the fate of Dostoevsky’s narrator in Notes from Underground, who sends away the prostitute Liza when she comes to his apartment, in the fear that her love will suffocate him, and thus compulsively and helplessly seals himself in his hole, cut off from everyone but a servant, living on daydreams which turn to nothingness, as his precursor, the narrator of Dostoevsky’s earlier novella, White Nights, tells us.\nThe Notebooks closes on a curiously negative note of hope.
