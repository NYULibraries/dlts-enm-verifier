        "pageText":"actions constitute takings and which do not. In part our malaise springs from the search for a “coherent master-rule,” a rule that cannot be found. According to Radin, “Situated moral judgment is required.” And a review of relevant cases leads Radin to the conclusion that “so far no one has been able to reduce these conventional, intuitive, contextually contingent baseline judgments to a set of formal rules.” With reference to the historical dimension of compensation, Radin says, “In the institution of property, corrective justice has its day but fades, continually overshadowed by present realities. This is a vital pragmatic compromise.” Indeed, intuition, context, and compromise pervade the decisions having to do with takings. Political context and political theory also enter into the judicial equation. She refers to “contextualized pragmatic decisions.” Our ideal of the “rule of law” drives us to transcend this kind of adjudication, but to no avail. Insofar as theories of property, politics, and personhood remain contested, the takings issue cannot be definitively resolved. Uncomfortable though it may be, the best we can have we already have, the “pragmatic practice of situated judgment.” By way of conclusion to her analysis, Radin proclaims that in the takings issue, “here as elsewhere in the law, we should recognize the pragmatic nature of the enterprise.”\nPart 5 addresses the problem of differing “legal cultures,” a legalistic way of referring to differing political theories or philosophies of life. Cass R. Sunstein informs us at the outset of his contribution that in our legal culture, “Principles of compensatory justice are the defining feature of the common law of tort, contract, and property.” But in today’s world, a world infested with “regulatory harms,” application of these principles generates perverse results. As alternatives to our inherited principles of compensatory justice Sunstein puts forward the principles of “risk management” and “nonsubordination.” According to Sunstein, subordination exists where and when “a difference irrelevant from the moral point of view has been turned, without sufficient reason, into a social disadvantage in important spheres of life.” Sunstein proceeds by way of a critique of the law having to do with small claim class actions, probabilistic torts, and regulatory harms. By way of an example of how compensatory thinking makes for trouble he points to the recalling of automobiles, ",
