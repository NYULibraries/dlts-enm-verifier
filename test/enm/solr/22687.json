        "pageText":"Jewish youth was through greater civil rights activism. Albert Chernin, the director of community consultation for the National Jewish Community Advisory Council, noted that many of the young Jewish students who took part in Freedom Summer in Mississippi in 1964 and did not identify as Jews were in fact acting as Jews but simply did not know it. According to Chernin, it was the job of Jewish community relations agencies to make them know it.61 A former Anti-Defamation League official, Murray Friedman, ventured to argue that the youngsters who participated in direct action protests in the South were acting as Jews in the sense that Judaism contains large doses of egalitarianism. “It is as if these boys were wearing their Yarmulkes without knowing it,” said Friedman.62 Marvin Schick, an orthodox Jewish writer and a New York City mayoral aid, even urged the orthodox community to meet alienated youth on their own turf. While he ruled out making religious compromises with this alienated youth, Schick felt that advocacy of civil rights by the orthodox community “can help to prepare the way for a relationship with alienated young Jews.”63\nBut, by all indications, it was unlikely that the adoption of more militant civil rights activities by the Jewish rank-and-file could have inspired a closer connection with young Jews who had identified more strongly with left-leaning social movements. Many of these activists consciously rejected any Jewish motive for their actions. One young Jewish “freedom fighter” who participated in a symposium in 1965 insisted that “it would be more accurate to call my background progressive, rather than Jewish.”64 Another participant explained that he decided to participate in Mississippi in the summer of 1964 because he identified more with being an American than with being a Jew. “I got involved in this great conflict with myself as to my role as a Jewish American,” he explained. “Was I to be the one to be pushing for the development of the State of Israel? Was I a Jew in that sense, or was I an American? I concluded that I was an American and that this [civil rights] was the struggle that was being fought.”65 Another participant explained his problem with defining Jewishness as his motivation for participating in “Freedom Summer.” “The trouble with this question is that when we say, what is there about being a Jew that brought you down [South], well, all kinds of people are down, Christians are down, and agnostics and atheists.” The young man explained that he thought it was “destructive” to bring “one’s Jewish tradition and background into this.”66\nSimilarly, the two most famous young Jews to participate in, and ultimately to give their lives to, the civil rights struggle in the South, Andrew ",
